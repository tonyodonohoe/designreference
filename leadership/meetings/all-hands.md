# All-hands

All-hands meetings, also known as town hall meetings, are regular gatherings that bring together all employees of an organisation. These meetings are designed to foster transparency, communication, and alignment within the company. During an all-hands meeting, leaders share important updates on the company's performance, goals, and strategic direction. This includes discussing recent achievements, challenges faced, and future plans. It's also an opportunity to celebrate milestones and recognise individual or team contributions.

Beyond information sharing, all-hands meetings encourage open dialogue and feedback. Employees are given a platform to ask questions, voice concerns, and provide suggestions. This two-way communication helps build trust and a sense of ownership among employees. These meetings can boost employee morale and foster a stronger company culture by reinforcing the company's values and mission.
