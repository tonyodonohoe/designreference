# PIP Meetings

The PIP meeting is a structured conversation between a manager and a team member whose performance needs improvement. The goal is to clearly communicate performance gaps, outline expectations, provide support, and establish an actionable plan for progress. A well-executed PIP aims to guide the team member back on track and align their performance with team standards.

Including a well-structured PIP meeting as part of a design manager's toolkit ensures performance issues are managed with empathy, clarity, and accountability. This approach not only sets the employee up for success but also strengthens team standards and morale by fostering a culture of continuous growth and clear expectations.

#### When to Use

The PIP meeting should be scheduled after a pattern of performance issues has been identified, and other feedback or coaching efforts have not led to improvement. The PIP is a formal, supportive step to address specific performance concerns and is typically used when clear, measurable change is needed for continued success in the role.

#### Preparation

1. **Gather Evidence:** Collect specific examples of the performance issues, including missed targets, behavioural concerns, or any repeated patterns.
2. **Define Expectations:** Be ready to clarify what success looks like. Frame specific, measurable goals that the employee must meet to successfully complete the PIP.
3. **Establish Support Resources:** Think about resources, training, or additional support that can aid in their development, such as mentorship, additional feedback sessions, or workshops.
4. **Create a Timeline:** Prepare a timeline for the PIP, including checkpoints for reviewing progress. Generally, these plans range from 30 to 90 days, depending on the level of support required.

#### During

1. **Set the Tone:** Start with a constructive tone, emphasising the intent to support improvement rather than impose penalties.
2. **Present the Plan:** Outline the areas of concern, referencing specific examples. Clarify the performance expectations and the measurable objectives they'll need to meet.
3. **Agree on Action Steps:** Collaboratively establish steps to achieve the goals. This might include new work habits, skill-building activities, or changes in workflow.
4. **Provide Support:** Identify resources that are available to help, like training materials or regular check-ins.
5. **Confirm Understanding:** Ask the team member to summarise their understanding of the PIP objectives and the support structure. Clarify any remaining questions or concerns they may have.
6. **Document the Conversation:** Make sure to document the meeting outcomes and next steps for both parties to reference.

#### After

1. **Scheduled Check-Ins:** Regularly scheduled follow-up meetings are essential to review progress, address obstacles, and adjust the plan if needed. This keeps the employee accountable and ensures they’re supported at each stage.
2. **Feedback and Adjustments:** Be open to making reasonable adjustments based on feedback and any new developments, while keeping the original goals in sight.
3. **Final Review:** At the end of the PIP period, meet to review progress against the objectives set out. Decide whether the team member has met expectations or if further action is required.

#### Tips

* **Focus on Growth:** Emphasise development and improvement rather than consequences. Reframe the PIP as a growth opportunity.
* **Set Achievable Goals:** Define realistic objectives that the employee can reasonably meet with the support provided.
* **Stay Consistent:** Ensure that the PIP is implemented fairly and consistently across the team to build trust and transparency.
