# Agile Meetings

#### Daily Stand-up

A daily stand-up is a quick daily check-in to sync on progress and blockers. Known simply as the "Standup", or "Daily Scrum" this meeting is typically fifteen-minutes long where agile teams review the previous day's progress, plan the tasks for the day ahead, and highlight any obstacles that might impact work.

Product Designer's Role:

* Share what they accomplished the previous day.
* Discuss any roadblocks they encountered.
* Outline their plan for the current day.

#### Backlog Refinement

In this session, the Scrum team reviews new items in the product backlog, clarifying requirements and goals as needed. There is flexibility in scheduling backlog refinement, allowing it to take place at any point during the sprint.

#### Sprint Planning

The main purpose of "Sprint Panning" is to plan the work for the upcoming sprint. At the start of each sprint, the team gathers to discuss their approach to achieving the sprint goal. They review the tasks chosen for the sprint and outline an initial plan, which can be adjusted in the daily scrum as needed.

Product Designer's Role

* Collaborate with the team to define user stories and acceptance criteria.
* Estimate the effort required for design tasks.
* Discuss potential design challenges and solutions.

#### Sprint Review

The main purpose of the Sprint Review is to review the completed work of the sprint and gather feedback. The sprint review takes place at the end of the sprint to assess the completed work. Stakeholders and subject matter experts from across the organisation join to provide feedback on what has been delivered.

Sprint reviews are different to sprint retrospectives in that they include both the team and the stakeholders in order to inspect the work done and seek feedback on the product. In other words they focus on the work done / product increment and its impact on achieving the Product Goal. Sprint Retrospectives on the other hand just typically involve the team and focus on the process and how the team worked together during the Sprint with an aim of identifying what went well, what didn't, and how to improve the process for future Sprints.

Product Designer's Role

* Present the final designs and prototypes.
* Gather feedback from stakeholders and the team.
* Address any design concerns or questions.

#### Sprint Retrospective

The main purpose of a Sprint Retrospective is to reflect on the past sprint and identify areas for improvement. The sprint retrospective happens at the end of each sprint, focusing on the entire Scrum team. With a positive and constructive approach, the team discusses ways to improve, identifying growth areas and action steps for the next sprint.

* Share their experiences and lessons learned.
* Participate in discussions about improving the design process.
* Suggest potential design improvements for future sprints.

#### Scrum of Scrums

The Scrum of Scrums is an additional event used when multiple Scrum teams work together on a single product. It follows a similar format to the daily scrum, enabling teams to update each other on progress, discuss obstacles, and outline next steps. This session helps keep teams aligned and manage dependencies across teams. When effectively facilitated, the Scrum of Scrums can foster a sense of collective ownership typical of self-organising teams.
