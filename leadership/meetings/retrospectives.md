# Retrospectives

A retro or retrospective meeting is a time for a team to look back on a project or a period of work. They discuss what went well, what could have been better, and what lessons they can learn for future projects. It's a way to improve and learn from past experiences.&#x20;

There are different types of retrospective meetings, each with their own unique structure and focus. However, they are typically held after a project or a sprint in agile environments. In essence, they are a post-sprint meeting to review what went well and what didn't in order to work more effectively going forward.

#### Sprint Retrospective

This is the most common type of retrospective, held at the end of each sprint in an Agile development process. The team reflects on the past sprint and three basic questions are asked.

* What actions would you start?
* What actions would you stop?
* What actions would you continue?
