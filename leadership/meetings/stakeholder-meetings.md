Stakeholder review meetings are gatherings where individuals with a vested interest in a project or business activity come together to discuss its progress, challenges, and future direction. These individuals, known as stakeholders, can include employees, clients, investors, partners, or even community members.&#x20;

By effectively conducting stakeholder review meetings, organisations can improve project outcomes, enhance collaboration, and build stronger relationships with their stakeholders.

#### Benefits

* **Shared understanding:** These meetings create a common understanding of the project's goals, objectives, and current status among all stakeholders.
* **Open communication:** They provide a platform for open and honest communication, allowing stakeholders to express their concerns, feedback, and suggestions.
* **Collaboration:** Stakeholder review meetings encourage collaboration and teamwork among different departments and individuals involved in the project.
* **Risk mitigation:** By identifying and addressing potential risks early on, these meetings help minimise negative impacts on the project.
* **Decision-making:** Stakeholder input can help inform important decisions and ensure that the project aligns with the overall business strategy.
* **Building relationships:** These meetings foster strong relationships between stakeholders, which can be beneficial for future collaborations.
