# Performance Reviews

### Overview

The Performance Review meeting is an essential tool for design managers to evaluate and discuss team members' achievements, challenges, development opportunities, and future goals. This meeting is not just a performance check-in; it's a structured opportunity for growth, recognition, and realignment.

Performance Review meetings are invaluable touchpoints to build trust, align on expectations, and support each team member's career journey. A well-prepared and thoughtfully delivered performance review can inspire and motivate your team, fostering a strong culture of growth and achievement.

### Objectives

* Review and assess performance against previously set objectives (e.g., OKRs, SMART goals).
* Provide constructive feedback and celebrate successes.
* Identify areas for development and skill-building.
* Set or adjust goals to align with team and organisational priorities.
* Strengthen the manager-team member relationship through open and honest dialogue.

### Preparation

_For Managers_

* **Review Performance Data**: Gather relevant performance data, including metrics, project feedback, OKRs, and any previous meeting notes. Ensure you have a balanced view of strengths and improvement areas.
* **Gather Feedback**: Collect multisource feedback (e.g., peer reviews, project stakeholder input) to provide a well-rounded assessment.
* **Set Key Topics**: Identify key points to cover, focusing on both achievements and areas where support is needed.
* **Prepare Documentation**: Ensure any official performance documents are ready to be shared or signed off during the meeting.

_For Team Members_

* Encourage team members to prepare by reflecting on their recent projects, challenges, and achievements. Consider providing a template or prompt to help them think about:
  * What they're proud of
  * Where they faced challenges
  * Skills they'd like to build next
  * Any feedback for you as a manager

### Meeting Structure

A typical Performance Review meeting can be broken down into four stages:

* **Opening and Context Setting** (5–10 minutes)\
  Begin with an encouraging note or general comments about the review's purpose. Ensure it's clear that this is a two-way discussion, not just an assessment.
* **Performance Feedback** (15–20 minutes)\
  Share your assessment of the team member’s performance. Recognise key achievements, discuss any challenges, and offer constructive feedback. Ensure your feedback is specific, actionable, and supportive.
* **Development Planning** (15–20 minutes)\
  Discuss areas for growth and any skill gaps, aligning them with the team member’s aspirations. Explore training, mentorship, or stretch assignments that could support their development. Use frameworks like SMART or OKR to set clear and measurable goals.
* **Goal Setting and Wrap-Up** (5–10 minutes)\
  Set or adjust performance goals, ensuring they are ambitious yet achievable. Summarise key points from the discussion and ensure both you and the team member are aligned on next steps.

### Tips

* **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Use data, examples, and concrete outcomes to support your feedback.
* **Encourage Self-Reflection**: Start by asking the team member to self-assess. This fosters a growth mindset and allows them to voice any concerns or goals first.
* **Maintain a Growth Focus**: Frame the discussion around growth, not just evaluation. Even constructive feedback should feel like an opportunity for improvement rather than criticism.
* **Follow-Up with a Summary**: Send a summary email or document highlighting key discussion points, goals, and any agreed-upon next steps. This reinforces accountability and provides a reference for future meetings.

### Post-Meeting Action Items

* **Track Progress**: Regularly check in on the goals and development areas identified during the review. Use shorter, informal check-ins to ensure progress and address any challenges.
* **Update Records**: Document the meeting outcomes, goals, and feedback in any performance tracking systems or files as required by the organisation.
* **Encourage Ongoing Dialogue**: Let your team member know that feedback isn’t limited to reviews; they should feel comfortable discussing their development at any time.

### Cadence

Performance Review meetings typically occur at set intervals to ensure consistent feedback and alignment. In most organisations, these meetings happen either biannually or annually, though some design managers also hold quarterly check-ins as part of a more frequent performance management rhythm.

* **Annual Performance Review**\
  Held at the end of the fiscal or calendar year, the annual review is a comprehensive assessment of the team member's contributions, achievements, and development over the past year. It’s often tied to compensation reviews, promotions, and career development planning.
* **Mid-Year Review**\
  A six-month check-in allows managers and team members to assess progress on goals set at the beginning of the year and make any necessary adjustments. This is also an opportunity to provide feedback on current projects and align on new or evolving priorities.
* **Quarterly Check-Ins (Optional)**\
  While not as formal as the annual or mid-year review, quarterly check-ins help maintain a steady flow of feedback and give team members frequent opportunities to recalibrate on goals. These sessions are ideal for discussing short-term objectives, adjusting priorities, and tackling any immediate challenges.

In addition to these formal reviews, consider having ongoing feedback sessions or project-based reviews after significant milestones, such as the completion of a major project or design sprint. This helps keep feedback timely, relevant, and actionable, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
