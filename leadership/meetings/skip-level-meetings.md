# Skip-level Meetings

### Overview

A skip-level meeting is a one-on-one meeting between an employee and their manager's manager, without the middle manager present. This type of meeting provides a unique opportunity for open communication and feedback between employees and senior leadership. Skip-level meetings can be a valuable tool for improving communication, fostering employee engagement, and driving organisational success.

They allow employees to:

* **Share insights and concerns directly with senior leadership:** Employees can bypass their immediate manager and voice their opinions on important issues, such as company culture, processes, or career development.
* **Gain new perspectives:** Senior leaders can offer valuable insights and advice based on their broader experience and knowledge of the organisation.
* **Build relationships with senior leaders:** Skip-level meetings foster a sense of connection and trust between employees and senior leadership, which can improve morale and engagement.

For senior leaders, skip-level meetings offer several benefits, including:

* **Gaining a deeper understanding of the organisation:** By hearing directly from employees, senior leaders can get a firsthand look at the challenges and opportunities facing the company.
* **Identifying potential talent:** Skip-level meetings can help identify high-potential employees who may be ready for greater responsibility.
* **Improving employee morale and engagement:** By taking the time to meet with employees, senior leaders can show that they value their input and are invested in their success.
