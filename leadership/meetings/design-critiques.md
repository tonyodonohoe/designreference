# Design Critiques

Design Crits AKA Design Review Meetings are focused on reviewing and critiquing design work, such as user interfaces (UI), user experiences (UX), and architecture, to ensure alignment with project goals and company standards.&#x20;

Designers present their work in structured sessions and the group - often including fellow designers, product managers, developers, and stakeholders - offers constructive feedback.&#x20;

The goal is to improve the design by identifying strengths and areas for improvement, ensuring the final product meets both user needs and business goals.

A typical design critique focuses on:

1. **User-Centric Feedback**: How well the design addresses user needs and behaviours.
2. **Design Principles**: Adherence to design principles like usability, accessibility, consistency, and aesthetics.
3. **Business Goals**: Alignment with the project's objectives and business requirements.
4. **Collaboration**: Encouraging teamwork and diverse perspectives to enhance the design.

Unlike casual feedback, design critiques follow a structured process, often with rules to ensure that feedback remains constructive and focused on the work rather than the designer. It's about improving the product rather than personal criticism.
