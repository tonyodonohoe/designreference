# Design Sprint

The Google Ventures Design Sprint is a five-day process that helps teams quickly solve big problems and test ideas by creating and validating a prototype. In this sprint, teams go through structured stages: understanding the problem, sketching ideas, deciding on the best solution, building a prototype, and testing it with real users. It's a fast, efficient way to gain insights and reduce risks before investing in full development. Design Sprints are an Ideation method and fit within the design process of an organisation.
