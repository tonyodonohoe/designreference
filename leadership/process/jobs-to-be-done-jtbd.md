# Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) is a framework that focuses on understanding the underlying reasons why people use products or services, emphasising the jobs they "hire" products to do rather than focusing solely on the products themselves. While JTBD bridges both strategy and process, it is often used during Discovery to help understand the user's true needs and motivations so, a more detailed explanation of the [Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)](https://ux.productdesignreference.com/ux-methods/discovery/jobs-to-be-done-jtbd) framework can be found in the Discovery section of companion site Product Design Reference.
