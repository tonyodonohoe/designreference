# Object-Oriented UX

Object-Oriented UX (OOUX) is a process and structured approach to designing digital products by focusing on the objects that users interact with, rather than the actions they take. OOUX helps designers create more user-friendly and efficient digital products by promoting a shared understanding between designers and developers, leading to more effective collaboration and faster development cycles.

OOUX typically involves the following steps:

1. **Object Identification:** Identify the core objects that make up your product and that are relevant to the user's mental model.
2. **Object Relationships:** Define how these objects relate to each other, creating a structured information architecture.
3. **Object Attributes:** Determine the key properties and characteristics of each object.
4. **Object Actions:** Define the actions that users can take on these objects.
5. **Information Architecture:** Organise the objects and their relationships into a clear and intuitive structure.
6. **User Interface Design:** Design the user interface based on the object-oriented structure, ensuring a consistent and intuitive experience.
