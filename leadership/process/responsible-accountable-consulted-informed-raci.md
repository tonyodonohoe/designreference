# Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI)

RACI, pronounced as "ray-see", is an acronym for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. It is a simple yet powerful matrix used to clarify roles and responsibilities within a project team and essentially a framework for effective project management. By assigning specific roles to each task, RACI ensures that everyone knows their part, preventing confusion, duplication of effort, and missed deadlines.

#### Understanding the RACI Roles

* **Responsible:** The person who carries out the task.
* **Accountable:** The person ultimately answerable for the task's completion.
* **Consulted:** The person whose input or opinion is sought.
* **Informed:** The person who needs to be kept up-to-date on the task's progress.

#### How to Implement RACI

1. **Identify the Project Tasks:** Break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks.
2. **Create a RACI Matrix:** This is a simple table with tasks listed in one column and the four RACI roles across the top.
3. **Assign Roles:** For each task, assign one person as Responsible, one as Accountable, and any necessary individuals as Consulted or Informed.
4. **Review and Refine:** Ensure that roles are clearly defined and that there are no overlaps or gaps.
5. **Communicate Effectively:** Share the RACI matrix with all team members to ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities.
