# Waterfall

"Waterfall" is a linear project management method with distinct, sequential phases. This sequential approach to project management and software development is a traditional methodology where progress flows steadily downwards through defined phases. These phases typically include requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next one begins, resembling a waterfall cascading down in a linear manner.

One of the key features of the waterfall model is its emphasis on extensive upfront planning and documentation. This methodology assumes that requirements can be clearly defined at the beginning of the project and that changes to those requirements are both infrequent and expensive.

While the waterfall model has been widely used in the past, it has certain limitations, particularly in today's fast-paced and dynamic business environment. Critics argue that its rigid structure can lead to difficulties in accommodating changes and responding to customer feedback effectively. As a result, many software development teams have adopted more flexible and iterative approaches such as Agile or DevOps.
