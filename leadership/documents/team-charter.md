# Team Charter

A team charter is a foundational document that defines a group's purpose, scope, and ways of working.&#x20;

Think of it as a "north star" for a project or a department. It ensures every member is aligned on why the team exists and how they will achieve their goals.

Rather than being a rigid set of rules, it is a collaborative agreement that prevents misunderstandings before they start.

#### Core Components of a Team Charter

Most effective charters cover these six primary areas:

**1. Purpose and Mission**

This section answers the "Why." It defines the team's reason for being and what success looks like in the long term.

**2. Roles and Responsibilities**

To avoid duplicated effort or tasks falling through the cracks, a charter lists who is responsible for what. This often includes:

* Team Lead\
  The primary point of contact.
* Scribe/Facilitator\
  Who manages the documentation.
* Subject Matter Experts\
  Specific technical or creative leads.

**3. Goals and Objectives**

These are the tangible outcomes the team needs to deliver. Good charters use SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) to track progress.

**4. Communication Norms**

This establishes how the team shares information.

* Which tools will be used (e.g., Slack, email, or project management software)?
* How often will the team meet?
* What is the expected response time for internal queries?

**5. Decision-Making Process**

Deciding how to decide is crucial for avoiding deadlock. Will the team use a majority vote, seek full consensus, or does the team lead have the final say?

**6. Conflict Resolution**

A proactive plan for what happens when people disagree. It outlines the steps to take to resolve professional friction before it becomes personal.

#### Why Use One?

* **Clarity**\
  It eliminates "role ambiguity" by clearly stating expectations.
* **Accountability**\
  Because the team creates it together, members feel a stronger sense of ownership.
* **Onboarding**\
  It serves as an excellent manual for new members joining mid-project.
* **Efficiency**\
  By pre-defining workflows, you spend less time arguing about process and more time doing the actual work.

#### Example Structure

* **Mission**: To deliver a high-quality marketing campaign for the 2026 product launch.
* **Values**: Transparency, punctuality, and creative courage.
* **Boundaries**: The team has the authority to spend up to £5,000 without further approval.
* **Operations**: Weekly stand-ups on Tuesdays at 10:00 AM.
