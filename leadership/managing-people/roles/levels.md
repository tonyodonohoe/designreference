A Lead is responsible for overseeing a team or project, balancing hands-on work with managerial duties. They provide direction, support, and mentorship to ensure project success and team development. Leads are often experienced professionals who coordinate with other departments, align team efforts with business goals, and tackle technical or design challenges. This level is key in fostering collaboration, maintaining quality, and guiding less-experienced team members toward achieving the team’s objectives.

### Associate

Associates are entry-level professionals who contribute to basic tasks and projects under supervision. They build foundational skills, learning from more experienced colleagues. Associates typically have limited experience but are expected to grow quickly, taking on increasingly complex work as they develop. They play a vital role in supporting team productivity and gaining hands-on experience that will prepare them for mid-level roles. Associate roles are critical for developing future talent and enhancing team capacity.

### Junior

Junior professionals are early in their careers, focusing on building essential skills and gaining practical experience. They work on well-defined tasks under guidance, often collaborating with senior team members for learning and support. Juniors are encouraged to ask questions, participate in team projects, and gradually take on more responsibility. This level provides a foundation for career growth, as juniors gain confidence, technical skills, and understanding of workflows necessary for progression.

Graduate roles are for recent university graduates who are starting their careers in a field. They receive structured training and support as they transition from academic learning to practical work experience.

Often part of a formal graduate programme, this level offers exposure to various projects and professional development opportunities. Graduate roles are designed to nurture future professionals, helping them build a career path within the organisation.

Interns are temporary team members, often students or recent graduates, gaining hands-on experience in a professional setting. They assist with entry-level tasks, learn about industry practices, and build skills under mentorship. Internships are usually limited in duration but provide valuable exposure to real-world projects and workflows. Interns are given opportunities to learn, develop connections, and explore career interests.
