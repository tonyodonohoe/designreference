# Feedback

Feedback is a powerful tool that can help individuals and organisations grow, learn, and improve. It provides valuable insights, identifies areas for development, and fosters a culture of continuous learning.&#x20;

Whether it's constructive criticism, positive reinforcement, or suggestions for improvement, feedback plays a crucial role in personal and professional growth.

#### Feedback Models

There are several methods and models for delivering feedback, each with its own approach to structuring and presenting information.

**1. Feedback Sandwich**

The Feedback Sandwich method involves structuring feedback in three parts: positive feedback, constructive criticism, and then concluding with more positive feedback. The idea is to cushion the critical feedback between two layers of praise to make it more palatable and to maintain the recipient's motivation and receptivity.

**2. SBI Model**

The SBI model provides a clear and structured way to give feedback by focusing on specific situations, behaviours, and their impacts. It involves:

* **Situation**\
  Describing the specific situation where the behaviour occurred.
* **Behaviour**\
  Detailing the observed behaviour.
* **Impact**\
  Explaining the impact of that behaviour on others or on the situation. This model helps in delivering clear, objective, and actionable feedback.

**3. Rose, Thorn, Bud Model**

The Rose, Thorn, Bud model is a feedback technique that categorises feedback into three areas. The rose represents the positive aspects or things that are working well. The thorn represents areas that are problematic or need improvement. And, the bud represents opportunities for growth or new ideas for development. This method helps to balance positive and negative feedback while also focusing on future possibilities.

**4. START Model**

The START model involves a structured approach to giving feedback by addressing specific elements of performance.

* **Situation**\
  It begins with describing the Situation where the behaviour occurred.
* **Task**\
  Next, it covers the Task or what was expected in that situation.
* **Action**\
  Then, it details the Action taken by the individual.
* **Result**\
  Following that, it discusses the Result or outcome of the action.
* **Follow-up**\
  Finally, it includes a Follow-up to discuss any further actions or improvements needed.

**5. DESC Model**

The DESC model is used to address and resolve conflicts effectively.

* **Describing**\
  It starts by Describing the specific behaviour or situation that is being addressed.
* **Expressing**\
  Then, it involves Expressing how the behaviour affects you or the team.
* **Specifying**\
  After that, it moves on to Specifying what you would like to see changed.
* **Consequences**\
  Finally, it outlines the Consequences of not making the change, providing a clear framework for discussing issues and expectations.

**6. GROW Model**

The GROW model is a coaching framework that helps individuals through problem-solving and goal-setting.

* **Goal**\
  It begins with defining the Goal or what you want to achieve.
* **Reality**\
  Then, it assesses the current Reality of the situation and any challenges faced.
* **Options**\
  Following that, it explores the Options or strategies available to achieve the goal.
* **Will**\
  Finally, it focuses on Will, deciding on the actions to be taken and committing to them.

#### Multisource Feedback

Multisource feedback is a process used to gather input about an individual from a diverse range of sources. These sources typically include managers, peers, subordinates, clients, and sometimes the individuals themselves. The feedback collected from these different perspectives is then compiled and presented to the individual, allowing them to compare their self-assessment with the evaluations provided by others.

This approach is valuable for development as it offers a comprehensive view of an individual's performance and behaviour. By integrating feedback from various sources, multisource feedback enhances self-awareness, promotes self-reflection, and highlights areas for potential improvement. Additionally, the anonymity of respondents is often considered crucial for the effectiveness of the process, as it encourages honest and candid feedback.

* **180-Degree Feedback**\
  180-degree feedback is a performance evaluation method where feedback is gathered from an individual's direct superior and, in some cases, from the individual themselves. This approach provides insights into an individual's performance from the perspective of their manager and allows for a comparison with the individual's own self-assessment. Unlike more comprehensive feedback systems, 180-degree feedback does not include input from peers or subordinates, focusing primarily on the top-down perspective. This method is useful for understanding how well an individual meets the expectations of their supervisor and can highlight areas for improvement based on this singular viewpoint.
* **360-Degree Feedback**\
  360-degree feedback is a comprehensive evaluation process that collects performance feedback from a variety of sources, including an individual's managers, peers, subordinates, and sometimes even clients or external stakeholders. This multi-perspective approach provides a well-rounded view of an individual's strengths and areas for development by comparing their self-assessment with the feedback from others who interact with them in different capacities. By incorporating diverse viewpoints, 360-degree feedback aims to build self-awareness, promote personal growth, and guide behaviour change based on a holistic understanding of performance.
