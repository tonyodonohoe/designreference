# Employee Exits

When an employee leaves a company, whether by choice or due to organisational changes, the process of their exit is critical in maintaining a healthy work environment and protecting the company's reputation.&#x20;

Employee exits are not merely transactional; they represent a key moment to reflect on employee experiences, gather feedback, and ensure a smooth transition. A well-managed exit process can foster positive relations, retain goodwill, and provide valuable insights that drive future improvements within the organisation.
