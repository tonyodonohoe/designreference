# Bad Managers

It's entirely possible that you, as a manager, might not be a good one. What's more, if you are a bad manager, there's a high chance that you're blissfully unaware of it. But don't worry, all is not lost. To become a great manager, you need just one quality: the willingness to look at yourself through an unbiased lens and make some changes, easy-peasy!

There are few, if any, leaders whose skills couldn't benefit from some improvement. No one is perfect, but as a manager, your flaws have a magnified impact on your team. This is why it's crucial to regularly assess yourself, seek feedback, and work on your skills. By doing so, you not only enhance your abilities but also create a better environment for your team to thrive.

Research consistently shows that poor management is a significant factor in employee turnover. Some studies even suggest that around 50% to 75% of employees who voluntarily leave their jobs cite their direct manager as a key reason for their departure. Poor management can lead to various issues such as lack of support, communication problems, micromanagement, and a negative work environment, all of which contribute to employees seeking opportunities elsewhere.

> "Gallup's most profound finding -- ever -- is probably this: 70% of the variance in team engagement is determined solely by the manager." - John Pitonyak and Rob DeSimone

#### Habits of Bad Managers

Bad managers tend to do these things:

* Neglect to regularly recognise the good work of team members.
* Unaware of what team members are doing day to day.
* React defensively or attack team members when they raise concerns or issues.
* Expect professionalism, output, and dedication from teams while not meeting these standards themselves, displaying hypocrisy and double standards.
* Fail to understand where their company's salary rates are relative to competitors and other similar roles.
* Micromanage teams and constantly feel the need to control every aspect of team's work, rather than have trust people to do their work effectively.
* Fail to provide clear direction leaving teams confused about priorities, tasks, or goals.
* Avoid difficult conversations and shy away from addressing performance issues, giving feedback, or handling conflicts.
* Take credit for the successes of the team without acknowledging their efforts.
* Neglect professional development and fail to support the growth and development of team members by not thinking about career progression or offering opportunities for learning, mentorship or advancement within the organisation.
* Show indifference and a lack of empathy and support to the well-being and concerns of the team rather than being empathetic, listening to team members, and offering work-related or personal support when needed.
* Dismiss or ignore feedback from team members rather than being open to feedback and willing to make changes to improve and benefit the team.
* Keep teams uninformed and show a lack of transparency about important decisions, changes, or company direction.
* Apply rules and expectations inconsistently, favouring some team members over others, which leads to an unfair work environment, resentment and disengagement.
* Fail to delegate by taking on too much due to a lack of trust in the team's abilities.
* Consistently expect long hours without recognising efforts or providing adequate rest, risking burnout and low productivity leading to burnout, decreased productivity, and high turnover rates.
* Fail to set or respect work-life boundaries, expecting constant availability from the team.
* Overlook or ignore conflicts, cliques, or toxic behaviours within teams, failing to manage team dynamics effectively rather than being attentive and addressing issues before they escalate.
* Fail to inspire by not taking steps to motivate or energise a team, leading to a lack of motivation and enthusiasm rather than finding ways to motivate and align work and goals with a sense of purpose.
* Resist new ideas or changes, clinging to outdated methods or processes, showing inflexibility rather than embracing innovation and adapting to changing circumstances.
* Regularly focus on the negative and highlight what a team is doing wrong without acknowledging successes.
* Fail to promote a diverse and inclusive workplace or tolerate discriminatory behaviour rather than ensuring all team members feel respected, valued, and included.
