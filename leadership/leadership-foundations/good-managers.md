# Good Managers

### Overview

When Andrea Stella was questioned about his leadership of the McLaren Formula 1 team following their resurgence after he assumed the Team Principal role in 2022, he said:

> "It is to enable, genuinely, not as a slogan, teamwork. Where teamwork has a clear direction where the team is going and everyone feels they want to contribute because they feel they have a role here. I want that to the point that I don’t even want to appear because that's about the team. I am an enabler."

Andrea's reluctance to take praise for what he views as the achievements of the team speaks volumes as to why McLaren quickly rose through the ranks of the other nine teams to challenge the leaders, Red Bull.

Brené Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston, defines leadership as the following:

> "A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes and has the courage to develop that potential."

There can be little doubt that management and leadership revolve around people and teams, with a manager's primary role being to act as an enabler and a force multiplier.

### Habits of Good Managers

Good managers tend to do these things:

* Have regular one-on-one meetings with direct reports to offer support and feedback.
* Use one-one-one meetings to discuss development, goals, and challenges, not just tasks.

### The Consensus on Effective Management
