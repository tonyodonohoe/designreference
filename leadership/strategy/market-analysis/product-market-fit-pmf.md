# Product-Market Fit (PMF)

One of the most critical strategic milestones for any product is achieving Product-Market Fit (PMF). PMF occurs when a product aligns perfectly with the needs and desires of its target market.&#x20;

For a design manager, this is a key focus area. By leading user research and testing, the design manager ensures that the product’s design is validated by real users and tailored to meet market demands. In this sense, the design manager's work directly impacts the company's broader strategy by helping to build products that not only attract but also retain customers, ultimately leading to sustainable growth.

In short, Product-Market Fit (PMF) is a crucial milestone in a startup's journey. It signifies that a product aligns perfectly with the needs and preferences of its target market, resulting in strong demand and customer satisfaction. Achieving PMF indicates that a product has found its place in the market, often leading to sustainable growth and profitability. It's a key validation point for startups and businesses aiming to succeed.
