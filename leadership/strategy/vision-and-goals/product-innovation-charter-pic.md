# Product Innovation Charter (PIC)

A key responsibility of a design manager is ensuring that the product's design contributes to the organisation's goals. This means understanding the company's mission and strategic vision, and aligning the design process with these larger objectives.&#x20;

The Product Innovation Charter (PIC) is particularly relevant here. A PIC outlines the strategic direction for new product development, including objectives, scope, and guidelines for innovation. As part of the leadership team, a design manager helps ensure that the product's design aligns with the innovation goals stated in the PIC, thereby driving forward-thinking and competitive design efforts. A design manager might contribute to or even create parts of the PIC, ensuring that the design strategy aligns with the company's innovation goals and long-term vision.

In short, a Product Innovation Charter is a document that outlines the strategic objectives, scope, and guidelines for innovation within a company. It provides a framework for decision-making, resource allocation, and alignment of efforts to drive product innovation and ensure it aligns with the organisation's goals and values.
