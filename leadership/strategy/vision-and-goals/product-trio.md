# Product Trio

"The Product Trio" is a term often used in product management to refer to the three key roles responsible for the success of a product. The primary focus of the product trio is on the strategic direction of the product. The three roles work together to define the product vision, set goals, and make strategic decisions about the product's future.

1. **Product Manager**\
   This role is responsible for the strategy of the product. They define the product vision, set the product roadmap, and prioritise features. They work closely with customers, the market, and the engineering team to ensure the product meets market needs and business objectives.
2. **Design Lead**\
   This role is responsible for the user experience of the product. They are concerned with the design of the user interface, user flows, and overall user experience. They work to ensure that the product is easy to use, intuitive, and delightful for the user.
3. **Tech Lead**\
   This role is responsible for the technical implementation of the product. They are concerned with the writing of the code, the infrastructure build, and ensuring the product is reliable, scalable, and secure. They work closely with the product manager and product designer to bring the product to life.
