# Weisbord's 6 Box Model

Weisbord's 6 Box Model is a powerful tool for diagnosing organisational issues and assessing overall performance. By analysing these six areas, the 6 Box Model helps organisations identify potential problems and opportunities for improvement. It can be used to diagnose specific issues, assess overall organisational health, and develop strategies for improvement.

It focuses on six key areas:

1. **Purpose:** This box examines the organisation's mission, vision, and goals. It assesses how well these are understood and shared by employees.
2. **Structure:** This box looks at the organisation's formal structure, including hierarchies, reporting lines, and decision-making processes. It evaluates whether the structure supports the organisation's goals.
3. **Relationships:** This box focuses on the quality of relationships between individuals and teams within the organization. It assesses communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution.
4. **Rewards:** This box examines the organisation's reward system, including compensation, recognition, and career development opportunities. It evaluates whether the reward system motivates and aligns with the organisation's goals.
5. **Leadership:** This box focuses on the leadership style and effectiveness of leaders within the organization. It assesses their ability to inspire, motivate, and guide employees.
6. **Helpful Mechanisms:** This box examines the systems and processes that support the organization's operations, such as information systems, HR practices, and financial systems. It assesses whether these mechanisms are efficient and effective.
