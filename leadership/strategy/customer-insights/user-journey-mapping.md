# User Journey Mapping

User Journey Mapping is a tool that design managers use to visualise the end-to-end experience of a user interacting with a product. By identifying pain points, gaps, and opportunities along the journey, design managers can make strategic decisions about where to focus design improvements. This not only enhances user satisfaction but also aligns the product's evolution with the organisation’s strategic goals, such as increasing conversion rates or reducing churn.
