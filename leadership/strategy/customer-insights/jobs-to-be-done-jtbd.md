# Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) is a framework that focuses on understanding the underlying reasons why people use products or services, emphasising the jobs they "hire" products to do rather than focusing solely on the products themselves.&#x20;

While JTBD bridges both Strategy and Process, it is often used during Discovery to help understand the user's true needs and motivations so, a more detailed explanation of the Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework can be found on our page in the Discovery section.
