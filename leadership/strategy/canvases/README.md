# Canvases

Canvases are visual frameworks used to structure and communicate complex ideas. They break down a concept into smaller, interrelated components, making it easier to analyse, brainstorm, and innovate. Examples include the Business Model Canvas, used to visualise a business model; the Value Proposition Canvas, which helps align value propositions with customer needs; the Lean UX Canvas, for rapid prototyping and iteration in product development; and the UX Research Canvas, for planning and executing user research studies.
