# Product Canvas

A versatile tool that helps you define a product's vision, target audience, features, and value proposition.

The Product Canvas is a strategic design tool used to define and visualise a product's core essence on a single page. It acts as a bridge between a vague initial idea and a detailed product backlog by capturing the most critical elements of the user experience and business goals. By bringing together the target audience, their specific problems, and the proposed features, the canvas ensures that everyone on the team is aligned and working towards the same objective.

Unlike a traditional business plan that focuses on financial projections, this method prioritises the user. It helps teams identify the unique value proposition of their product and the key tasks a person needs to complete. This bird's eye view makes it much easier to spot gaps in logic or potential risks before significant time and resources are spent on development.

In practice, the canvas is often used during the early stages of a project or when a product needs a significant pivot. It encourages collaborative discussion and serves as a living document that can be updated as the team learns more about their users. Because it is simple and concise, it allows stakeholders to quickly understand what is being built and why it matters to the market.
