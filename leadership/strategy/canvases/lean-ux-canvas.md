# Lean UX Canvas

The Lean UX Canvas is good for fast, collaborative decision-making and provides a framework for rapid experimentation and iteration in the design process. It emphasises collaboration across teams and quick validation of design hypotheses. For a design manager, this tool is useful for keeping the design process agile and ensuring that design decisions are grounded in user feedback and business needs. By reducing time spent on unnecessary documentation and focusing on outcomes, the Lean UX Canvas enables the team to move quickly and align with strategic priorities.

"Lean UX Canvas is a tool designed to help teams quickly capture and validate their ideas, with focus on user experience and iterative development."
