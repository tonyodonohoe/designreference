# Value Proposition Canvas

The Value Proposition Canvas is a specialised tool designed to ensure that a product or service actually meets the needs of its intended customers. It works by looking at two sides of the same coin: the customer profile and the value map. By mapping these out, teams can see exactly how their features help users complete tasks, solve their frustrations, and achieve the benefits they are looking for. This focus helps to prevent the common mistake of building a product that nobody wants to buy or use.

The first part of the canvas focuses on the customer by identifying their daily jobs, the pains they experience, and the gains they hope to find. This encourages a deep level of empathy and forces the team to look at the world through the user's eyes rather than their own. Once these are understood, the second part of the canvas describes the products and services being offered, specifically highlighting how they act as pain relievers or gain creators. The ultimate goal is to achieve a "fit" where the product's value perfectly aligns with the customer's requirements.

Using this method helps to clarify the marketing and design strategy by pinpointing the most important reasons why a person would choose one solution over another. It is a highly collaborative exercise that can be used to refine an existing product or to test the feasibility of a brand new idea. Because the canvas is visual and straightforward, it makes it easy for stakeholders to understand the core logic behind a business model and to identify which features are truly essential for success.
