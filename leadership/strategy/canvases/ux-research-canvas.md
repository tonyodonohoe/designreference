# UX Research Canvas

The UX Research Canvas is a tool designed to help teams plan, organise, and conduct user research in a structured way.

The UX Research Canvas is a practical planning tool designed to help teams organise and focus their research efforts before they start talking to users. It serves as a central hub where researchers and stakeholders can agree on what they actually need to learn and why. By mapping out the project goals, the specific questions that need answering, and the intended outcomes, the canvas ensures that no time is wasted on irrelevant data collection.

This method is particularly useful for breaking down complex projects into manageable steps. It prompts the team to identify their target participants, choose the most effective research methods, and acknowledge any assumptions or constraints they might face. Because all this information is displayed in one clear space, it becomes much easier to spot gaps in the plan or identify potential biases that could skew the results.

In a collaborative environment, the canvas acts as a communication bridge that keeps everyone aligned on the research purpose. It prevents the common problem of "research for research's sake" by forcing a clear link between the gathered insights and the eventual design decisions. Once the canvas is complete, the team has a solid roadmap that guides them through the entire process, from the first interview to the final report.
