# Overview

#### The Role of a Design Manager in Strategy

A design manager's involvement in strategy can vary depending on the organisation, but they often have significant input into areas related to product vision, roadmap development, and aligning design with business goals. Typically, designer managers may not be solely responsible for high-level organisational strategy, but they are responsible for ensuring that design efforts support the broader business strategy. The success of a product is often determined by how well it fits the market, meets user needs, and contributes to the company's long-term vision. As such, a design manager needs to integrate design thinking with strategic planning.

The role of a design manager is deeply intertwined with strategy and makes decisions that shape not only design but also the overall success of a product. While the primary focus of the design manager is on creating a great user experience, their contribution to strategic planning and decision-making ensures that design efforts support and advance the organisation's long-term goals. Design is not just about aesthetics - it's about making strategic choices that drive business success and create impact.
