# Design Roles

### Specialist vs Generalist

* **Specialist Roles**\
  These roles require deep expertise in a single area, such as backend development or UX research. Specialists are typically brought in for their specific knowledge and are crucial to solving complex challenges in their domain.
* **Generalist Roles**\
  Generalists have a broader skill set and can contribute to a variety of tasks. They are often valued in startups or smaller teams where flexibility and adaptability are key.

### T-Shaped vs V-Shaped

* **T-Shaped Designers**\
  Designers with deep expertise in one area (such as visual design or interaction design) but also possess a broad understanding of related fields (like UX research or coding). This makes them adaptable and valuable in cross-functional teams.\\
* **V-Shaped Designers**\
  Designers who have deep specialisation in two or more areas, allowing them to take on more complex, integrated challenges. These designers can often bridge gaps between disciplines, making them ideal for projects requiring multifaceted expertise.

### Visual vs Spatial Thinkers

Visual thinkers are those who, when thinking, have the ability to visualise images, symbols, objects and scenes, turning abstract concepts into mental pictures.

Spatial visualisers, on the other hand, think by understanding abstractly the position of objects, their shapes, and their relational distances in space, often translating into a grasp of maps, charts, and spatial orientation.

### Vertical vs. Lateral Promotion

While vertical promotions are often the default, lateral moves can be just as valuable. By understanding both options, you can make more informed decisions about your team's promotions and ensure that they are aligned with both individual career goals and the overall objectives of the organisation.

#### Vertical Promotion

* **What it is:** This is the traditional promotion path. It involves moving an employee to a higher-level position within the company. Think of it like climbing a ladder.
* **Benefits for the employee:** Increased salary, more responsibilities, and often, a larger team to manage.
* **Benefits for the manager:** A stronger leadership team, improved morale, and a clear path for career advancement within the organization.

#### Lateral Promotion

* **What it is:** This is a more modern approach. It involves moving an employee to a different role at the same level of responsibility. Think of it like moving from one room to another on the same floor.
* **Benefits for the employee:** Exposure to new departments or projects, opportunities to learn new skills, and potentially, a change of pace.
* **Benefits for the manager:** Increased team flexibility, improved knowledge sharing, and reduced risk of burnout among employees.

#### Why Lateral?

Promoting someone laterally, rather than vertically, can be a strategic decision driven by various factors. Sometimes, a manager recognises that an employee has already mastered their current role, but moving them upwards might not be the best next step for their development or for the needs of the organisation. Instead, a lateral move can expose them to different areas of the business, broadening their skills and knowledge in a way that a vertical promotion might not. It also offers the employee a new challenge without the pressure of jumping into a higher-level leadership position prematurely.

Additionally, lateral moves can be an opportunity to groom someone for a future vertical promotion by giving them a chance to expand their experience, work with new teams, or take on a different set of responsibilities. This can strengthen their abilities and prepare them more thoroughly for a future role that requires a wider perspective.

From the business side, a lateral promotion can help address gaps in other teams or departments without losing a valuable employee's expertise. It allows an organisation to be more flexible with talent, ensuring the right people are in the right places to contribute where they're needed most, while also keeping the employee engaged and motivated.

### Career Pathing

Career pathing outlines the possible progression for employees, from entry-level positions to senior leadership. It’s important to provide a roadmap that helps employees understand how they can grow and what skills or experiences they need to move forward.

### Remote, Hybrid & Onsite

The rise of remote work has given employees more flexibility, allowing teams to work from different locations. Remote roles require strong communication and time management skills, while on-site roles can benefit from in-person collaboration.

### Matrix vs Hierarchical

* **Matrix Structure**\
  Employees report to multiple managers - typically a project manager and a functional manager. This structure fosters collaboration but can lead to complexity in decision-making.\\
* **Hierarchical Structure**\
  Traditional top-down management structure where employees report to one manager. It's clear and straightforward but can lead to slower decision-making and less innovation.

### Cross-functional Teams

Cross-functional teams bring together members from different departments - such as design, engineering, product, and marketing - to collaborate on projects. This approach fosters innovation, reduces silos, and ensures that different perspectives are considered throughout the product development process.
