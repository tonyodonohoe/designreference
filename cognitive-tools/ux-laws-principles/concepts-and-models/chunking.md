# Chunking

Chunking is a memory technique that groups individual pieces of information into larger, more meaningful units (or "chunks"). This strategy significantly increases the amount of information the user can process and retain.

Chunking directly leverages Miller's Law, which suggests that the average person can only hold about 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their Working Memory at once. By combining multiple data points into a single, recognisable "chunk," designers can circumvent this limitation and vastly reduce Cognitive Load.

#### Why Chunking Works

* Reduces Cognitive Load: Instead of forcing the brain to process many discrete data points, the interface presents fewer, larger, and more recognizable units.
* Enhances Memorability: Grouped information is easier to encode into long-term memory than a stream of random, unorganized data.
* Improves Scanning: Users can quickly locate the required information block without reading every item individually.

#### Practical UX Applications of Chunking

Chunking is one of the most fundamental tactics for improving readability and data entry:

**1. Data Formatting**

* Application: Breaking up long strings of numbers or letters into smaller, fixed-length groups.
* Examples:
  * Phone numbers: $$555−123−4567$$ (instead of 5551234567)
  * Credit Card numbers: $$4242 4242 4242 4242$$
  * Confirmation codes: $$ABC−123−XYZ$$

**2. Interface and Content Structure**

* Application: Grouping related content, actions, or navigation elements using visual proximity.
* Examples:
  * Navigation Menus: Grouping 10 links into 3 or 4 top-level categories.
  * Forms: Separating a long form into sections with distinct headings (e.g., "Personal Info," "Shipping Address," "Payment Details").
  * Body Text: Using bullet points, short paragraphs, and clear headings to break up large walls of text.

**3. Sequential Task Flow**

* Application: Breaking a complex, multi-step process into sequential, manageable stages.
* Example: A checkout process that uses a Progress Indicator to show "Cart," "Shipping," "Payment," and "Review." Each step is a manageable chunk of the overall task.

#### Takeaway

Don't make users count. Group information logically so the brain perceives it as a single, easily digestible unit.
