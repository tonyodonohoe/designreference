# Cognitive Load

Cognitive Load refers to the total amount of mental effort that is required to use a product. Specifically, it's the amount of working memory resources used in the brain while performing a task.

In User Experience (UX) design, the goal is always to minimise cognitive load. When a user's mental effort is unnecessarily high, it leads to friction, frustration, errors, and often, the abandonment of the task or the product itself. A high cognitive load is a barrier to adoption and a sign of poor usability.

#### Three Types of Cognitive Load

Cognitive load is typically broken down into three interacting types:

**1. Intrinsic Load**

* Definition: The inherent difficulty of the task itself, related to the complexity of the information.
* Example: Learning a new, complex programming language.
* UX Mitigation: Designers manage it by chunking information into smaller, digestible steps (e.g., breaking a long form into multiple pages).

**2. Extraneous Load**

* Definition: The mental effort imposed by the way the information or task is presented—the design itself. This is the primary target for reduction in UX.
* Example: A website with inconsistent navigation, confusing jargon, or cluttered visuals.
* UX Mitigation: Applying established design principles like consistency, clear hierarchy, and minimalist aesthetics to reduce unnecessary mental effort.

**3. Germane Load**

* Definition: The "good" cognitive load. It's the mental effort dedicated to the actual learning, comprehension, and development of mental models (schemas).
* Example: Successfully mapping an app's navigation to real-world tasks.
* UX Goal: Designers aim to optimise this load by ensuring the user's focus is on understanding the core task, not wrestling with the interface.

#### Applying Cognitive Load Theory to Design

Effective UX design is about shifting the mental burden from the user to the system. Here are strategies to reduce load:

**Consistency**

* Reduction Method: Reduces Extraneous Load by allowing the user to rely on learned patterns rather than constantly learning new ones.
* Application: Use the same icons, terminology, and layout across all pages.

**Chunking**

* Reduction Method: Manages Intrinsic Load by reducing the number of individual items the user must hold in working memory (see [Miller's Law](../psychology/millers-law.md)).
* Application: Group related information together (e.g., credit card number, expiration date, and CVV on a payment form).

**Familiarity**

* Reduction Method: Reduces Extraneous Load by leveraging the user's existing mental models (schemas) from other apps and websites.
* Application: Use well-known design patterns (e.g., the shopping cart icon, a standard footer layout).

**Visual Hierarchy**

* Reduction Method: Reduces Extraneous Load by preventing the user from having to visually scan and parse every element on the screen equally.
* Application: Use size, colour, contrast, and white space to guide the user's eye to the most important elements.

**Progressive Disclosure**

* Reduction Method: Manages both Intrinsic and Extraneous Load by staggering complexity and reducing the number of decisions the user faces upfront.
* Application: Show only the necessary features by default, and allow users to access advanced options only when they need them.

#### The Cost of High Cognitive Load

When users are forced to expend too much mental energy on a digital product, the consequences include:

* Increased Errors: Users are more likely to make mistakes when their attention is split between complex information and a complex interface.
* Reduced Retention: They are less likely to remember how to use your product the next time they return.
* Task Abandonment: In moments of frustration, users will quit the task (e.g., leaving a checkout process).
* Negative Affect: The user associates the product with feelings of stress, annoyance, or confusion, damaging brand perception.

#### The Golden Rule

Always strive to design systems that are invisible. The user should be focused on achieving their goal, not on figuring out your interface.
