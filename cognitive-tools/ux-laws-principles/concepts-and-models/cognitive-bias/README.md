# Cognitive Bias

Cognitive Biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment.&#x20;

They are mental shortcuts that the brain uses to process information quickly and efficiently. While these shortcuts are useful for fast decision-making, they can lead to errors and distorted perceptions of reality.

In User Experience (UX) design, understanding cognitive biases is crucial because they profoundly influence how users perceive, interact with, and make decisions about digital products. A good UX designer anticipates and accounts for these biases to create interfaces that are clear, persuasive, and user-friendly.

#### Why Biases Matter in UX

Cognitive biases can dictate many aspects of a user's interaction:

* **Perception of Value:** Biases affect whether a user thinks a product is worth the price or the effort to use.
* **Navigation & Discovery:** They influence what users pay attention to on a screen and which paths they choose to take.
* **Trust & Credibility:** Biases shape how quickly a user trusts a website, app, or piece of information presented to them.
* **Decision-Making:** They drive choices, from clicking a specific button to completing a purchase.

By intentionally designing with these biases in mind, you can guide users toward desired actions, minimise friction, and create a more satisfying experience.

**Anchoring Bias**

The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions.

_Example: Show a high original price (the anchor) struck out next to a lower sale price to make the sale price seem like a much better deal._

**Confirmation Bias**

The tendency to search for, interpret, favour, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values.

_Example: In search or filtering, showing results or suggestions that align with a user's past behaviour or stated preferences (e.g., "People who bought this also bought...")._

**Loss Aversion**

The psychological tendency for losses to have twice the impact on people as equivalent gains. People prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains.

_Example: Framing features as things a user will lose if they cancel a service ("Don't lose access to...") rather than things they will gain if they sign up._

There are dozens of cognitive biases that shape how we think and make decisions, often without us realising. Here are some of the most influential ones, especially in business, strategy, and everyday judgment.

#### &#x20;Common Cognitive Biases in Decision-Making

* **Confirmation Bias**: Tendency to seek out or interpret information in a way that confirms our existing beliefs.
* **Anchoring Bias**: Relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor") when making decisions.
* **Availability Heuristic**: Overestimating the importance of information that comes to mind easily, often because it's recent or vivid.
* **Loss Aversion**: Preference to avoid losses rather than acquire equivalent gains; losing €100 feels worse than gaining €100 feels good.
* **Overconfidence Bias**: Overestimating our own abilities, knowledge, or control over outcomes.
* **Status Quo Bias**: Favouring the current state of affairs and resisting change, even when alternatives may be better.
* **Framing Effect**: Decisions are influenced by how information is presented e.g., "90% survival rate" vs. "10% mortality rate."
* **Endowment Effect**: Valuing something more simply because we own it.
* **Bandwagon Effect**: Adopting beliefs or behaviours because many others do "everyone's doing it."
* **Hindsight Bias**: Believing, after an event has occurred, that we "knew it all along."
* **Dunning-Kruger Effect**: People with low ability at a task overestimate their ability, while experts may underestimate theirs.

These biases can creep into everything from product development to hiring decisions to personal relationships.&#x20;

#### How to Use This in Practice

* **Team Workshops**: Run a "Bias Spotting" session where teams reflect on past decisions and identify which biases may have influenced them.
* **Strategy Reviews**: Use this table as a checklist when evaluating new initiatives. Ask "Are we falling into any of these traps?"
* **Leadership Coaching**: Help managers recognise bias in hiring, performance reviews, and resource allocation.
