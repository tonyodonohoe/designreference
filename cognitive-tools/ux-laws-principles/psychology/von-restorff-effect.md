# Von Restorff Effect

The Von Restorff Effect, or isolation effect, is a psychological phenomenon that describes how people tend to remember distinctive or unique items more easily than those that are similar to others.&#x20;

In simpler terms, if you have a list of things, and one of them stands out because it's different in some way (e.g., a unique colour or shape), you're more likely to remember that particular item compared to the others. It's like a "standout" effect in your memory. This effect is named after the German psychiatrist Hedwig von Restorff, who first identified it.
