# Miller's Law

Miller's Law suggests that people can typically hold about seven (plus or minus two) pieces of information in their working memory at once.&#x20;

It means our minds can effectively process and remember around five to nine things at a time. This idea can be useful when designing things like phone numbers or lists to make them more manageable for people to remember and work with.
