# Serial Position Effect

The Serial Position Effect or sometimes called The Serial Position Principle is a psychological concept that says people tend to remember things at the beginning and end of a list better than the things in the middle. It encompasses both the Primacy Effect and the Recency Effect.

The **Primacy Effect** is like the "first impression." People tend to remember the items at the beginning of a list better. It's a bit like when you meet someone for the first time; you remember that meeting more clearly.

The **Recency Effect** is about what you remember last. Items at the end of the list are often remembered well because they are still fresh in your mind, just like how you can easily recall what you did recently.

However, the things in the middle of the list are usually the hardest to remember.
