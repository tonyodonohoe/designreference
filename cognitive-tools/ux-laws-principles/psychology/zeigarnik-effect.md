# Zeigarnik Effect

The Zeigarnik Effect basically says that we tend to remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. It's like when you're watching a TV show, and they end it with a cliffhanger; you can't stop thinking about what happens next. This happens because our brains find it easier to remember things that are left unfinished, creating a kind of mental tension that encourages us to complete those tasks. It's a bit like having a mental to-do list that keeps nagging at you until you finish what you started.
