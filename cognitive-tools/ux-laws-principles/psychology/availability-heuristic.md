The Availability Heuristic is a mental shortcut that our brains use to make decisions quickly. It's based on the idea that if something comes to mind easily, we tend to think it's more common or important.&#x20;

For example, if you've recently heard a lot about shark attacks in the news, you might think they happen all the time, even though they are quite rare.&#x20;

This heuristic can lead to biases in our thinking because it relies on what's readily available in our memory rather than a more accurate assessment of the actual frequency or probability of events.
