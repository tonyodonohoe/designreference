# Similarity

The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.

The principle of similarity is about things that look alike. When objects share similar characteristics, like color, shape, or size, our brains tend to group them together, seeing them as part of the same set or category.
