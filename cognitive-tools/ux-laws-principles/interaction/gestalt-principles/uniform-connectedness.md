# Uniform Connectedness

Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.

Uniform connectedness is a Gestalt principle that occurs when elements are physically linked by a shared visual property, such as a background colour, a border, or a connecting line. Our brains naturally perceive these linked items as a single group or unit, even if they are different shapes or sizes. This is a very strong grouping cue that often overrides other principles like similarity or proximity, making it a reliable way for designers to show that certain pieces of information belong together.

In digital design, you often see this principle applied in navigation bars or card layouts. By placing several distinct links inside a single coloured box or container, you tell the user that all those links serve the same general purpose. Without that shared container, the links might look like scattered, unrelated pieces of text. Using a simple line to connect two icons can also indicate a functional relationship, such as a timeline of events or a multi-step checkout process where one action leads directly to the next.

This method is particularly useful for reducing the mental effort required to understand a complex interface. By creating clear visual boundaries or connections, you help the user categorise information at a glance. It is important, however, to ensure that the connection is obvious and consistent. If a container is too large or a connecting line is too faint, the sense of unity is lost, and the user may become confused about how the different elements on the screen relate to one another.
