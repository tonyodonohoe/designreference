# Focal Points

Elements with a point of interest, emphasis or difference will capture and hold the viewer's attention.

The focal point principle is a Gestalt rule that explains how our eyes are naturally drawn to any element that looks different from its surroundings. In a sea of similar items, the one that stands out through a change in colour, shape, size, or texture immediately captures the user's attention. This is a fundamental tool in user experience design because it allows you to highlight the most important action you want a person to take, such as signing up for a newsletter or adding an item to a shopping basket.

To create an effective focal point, you must establish a sense of contrast against the rest of the layout. If every element on a page is bright and bold, nothing will truly stand out, leading to a cluttered and confusing experience. By keeping the majority of the interface consistent and understated, you ensure that the one area you have highlighted becomes the clear starting point for the user. This helps people process information faster because they do not have to search for where to click or what to read first.

It is also vital to use this principle sparingly to maintain its impact. Having too many focal points on a single screen creates visual noise and can lead to decision paralysis, where the user feels overwhelmed and ends up doing nothing at all. When applied correctly, a well-placed focal point acts as a visual landmark that guides the user through a digital product with ease and confidence.
