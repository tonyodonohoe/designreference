# Hick's Law

Hick's Law is a psychological principle that states the more choices or options you have, the longer it takes to make a decision.&#x20;

It suggests that as the number of choices increases, the time it takes to decide also increases. So, if you're presented with many alternatives, it might take you longer to make a choice because your brain needs more time to process and evaluate each option.&#x20;

This concept is often used to emphasise the importance of simplicity and minimising choices in design and decision-making to improve efficiency.
