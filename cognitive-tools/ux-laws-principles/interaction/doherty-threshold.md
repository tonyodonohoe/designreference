# Doherty Threshold

Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.&#x20;

The Doherty Threshold suggests when a computer or device responds quickly to a user's input, it can improve the overall user experience. It's named after Walter J. Doherty, who conducted research in this area.&#x20;

When you click or tap something on your computer or smartphone, and it reacts almost instantly, it feels better for you as a user. It's like when you press a button, and something happens right away, which makes you feel more satisfied with the technology you're using.
