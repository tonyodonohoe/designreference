# Rule of Thirds

The "Rule of Thirds", not to be confused with the "[Rule of Three](../behaviour/rule-of-three.md)", is applied in UI UX design to create visual interest by placing important elements in the four focal points. This ensures that the user's gaze is focused on what matters the most without being distracted. It increases engagement and improves the chances of users taking action.
