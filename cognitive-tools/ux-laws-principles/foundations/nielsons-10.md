# Nielson's 10

Jakob Nielsen's [10 general principles for interaction design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). They are called "heuristics" because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines.

1. Visibility of System Status
2. Match Between the System and the Real World
3. User Control and Freedom
4. Consistency and Standards
5. Error Prevention
6. Recognition Rather than Recall
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
9. Help Users Recognise, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
10. Help and Documentation
