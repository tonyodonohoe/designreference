# Poka-Yoke Principle

The Poka-Yoke Principle is a concept originating from Japanese manufacturing processes, particularly associated with the Toyota Production System.&#x20;

"Poka-Yoke" translates to "mistake-proofing" or "error-proofing."&#x20;

The principle aims to prevent or detect errors during manufacturing or processing to avoid defects in the final product.

There are two main approaches to Poka-Yoke:

1. **Prevention**: This involves designing processes or systems in a way that makes errors impossible or extremely difficult to occur. For example, using shape-coded connectors that only fit into corresponding slots prevents assembly mistakes.
2. **Detection**: This approach involves implementing mechanisms to detect errors as soon as they occur so that corrective action can be taken promptly. An example is an alarm that sounds when an incorrect part is inserted into a machine.

The Poka-Yoke Principle is about designing systems and processes with built-in safeguards to ensure quality and prevent errors or defects from occurring. It promotes efficiency, reduces waste, and enhances overall product quality.
