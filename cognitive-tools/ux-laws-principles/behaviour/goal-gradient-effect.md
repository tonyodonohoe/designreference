# Goal-Gradient Effect

The Goal-Gradient Effect is a psychological principle that suggests people tend to work harder and feel more motivated as they get closer to achieving a goal. It's like when you're running a race, and as you get nearer to the finish line, you often find an extra burst of energy to give it your all.

Imagine you have a loyalty card for a coffee shop where you get a free coffee after buying ten. When you start, it might take a while to get those first few stamps. But as you get closer to the goal of getting that free coffee, you'll probably visit the coffee shop more frequently and make an effort to buy coffee more often. The closer you get to your goal, the more determined you become to reach it.

The Goal-Gradient Effect is all about how we become more motivated and driven as we approach our desired outcome. It's like a natural boost of enthusiasm to help us reach the finish line or achieve our goals.
