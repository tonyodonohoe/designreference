# Parkinson's Law

Parkinson's Law is a principle that suggests work expands to fill the time available for its completion.&#x20;

If you have a task or project and you give yourself a certain amount of time to finish it, you'll probably end up taking that entire time, even if the task could have been completed more quickly.&#x20;

This law highlights how time management and deadlines can impact productivity and efficiency. So, if you want to be more efficient, consider setting shorter, realistic deadlines to avoid unnecessary delays.
