# Peak-End Rule

The Peak-End Rule is a psychological concept that suggests people judge their past experiences or events based on the peak (the most intense or memorable moment) and the end (how it concluded) of that experience rather than considering the overall average of the entire event.

Imagine if you had a vacation, for example, and it had some really amazing moments (the peak) and a nice ending, you're more likely to remember the whole vacation positively, even if there were boring or less enjoyable parts in between. So, it's not about the entire experience but rather the high point and how it all wrapped up that shapes your memory of it.
