# Fresh Start Effect

The Fresh Start Effect is a psychological phenomenon related to the way people perceive and approach new beginnings or fresh starts, such as the start of a new year, a new job, or even the beginning of a new week. It's a concept that transcends language differences and is relevant in various cultures and regions.

The basic idea is that individuals tend to view the beginning of a new period as an opportunity to break with past habits and make positive changes in their lives. This often leads to increased motivation and commitment to self-improvement goals. People are more likely to set and work towards new resolutions or goals during these fresh start moments.

The term "Fresh Start Effect" was coined in the context of behavioural economics and psychology. Researchers have observed that people are more inclined to set ambitious goals and engage in self-improvement actions at the start of a new temporal period, whether it's a new year, a new month, or even a new day.

This effect can be related to the human desire for renewal and the perception of new beginnings as a clean slate where past mistakes and failures are left behind. It's a phenomenon that has implications for areas like goal setting, self-help, and marketing, where businesses often target consumers during these fresh start moments to promote products and services related to self-improvement and personal development.

The Fresh Start Effect can be utilised in design in several ways:

1. **User Onboarding:** When users first encounter a new product or service, they are essentially experiencing a fresh start. Designers can leverage this by creating welcoming and intuitive onboarding experiences that guide users through the initial steps, helping them set up their accounts and begin using the product. This is a crucial moment to engage users and encourage them to explore further.
2. **Setting User Goals:** Understanding that users may be more motivated to set and achieve new goals during fresh start moments, designers can incorporate features and prompts that allow users to define their objectives. For example, a fitness app might encourage users to set fitness goals at the start of a new year or week.
3. **Visual Refresh:** Periodic updates to the visual design of an app or website can trigger the Fresh Start Effect. Redesigns can give users a sense of renewal and may make them more receptive to changes or new features. However, it's important to strike a balance so that the changes are not too disruptive.
4. **Feedback and Progress Tracking:** Designers can make use of progress tracking and feedback mechanisms to help users see how far they've come since their last interaction with the product. This can enhance the sense of a fresh start by emphasising the user's journey and achievements.
5. **New Feature Introductions:** If a product is adding new features, launch them strategically during fresh start moments. Users may be more open to exploring and adopting these new features when they're in a mindset of making improvements or changes.
6. **Behavioural Triggers:** Designers can incorporate triggers, such as reminders or notifications, to encourage users to revisit and engage with the product during fresh start moments. This can help maintain user engagement over time.
7. **Personalization:** Utilise data and user preferences to offer personalised recommendations or content when users start afresh. Personalisation can make users feel like the product understands their needs and is tailored to their unique goals.
8. **User-Cantered Design:** Recognise that people may have different motivations and goals during fresh start moments. Designers should conduct user research to understand these motivations and tailor the design to meet users' changing needs and aspirations.

The Fresh Start Effect can be a valuable concept for designers to consider when creating and enhancing digital experiences. Leveraging the psychological factors associated with fresh starts can lead to more engaging and effective user interfaces, enhancing user satisfaction and retention.
