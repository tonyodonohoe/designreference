# Rule of Three

The "Rule of Three", not to be confused with the "[Rule of Thirds](../interaction/rule-of-thirds.md)", is a principle that suggests that things are more appealing, memorable, and effective when presented in groups of three. This concept is often used in various fields, including writing, design, and communication. It's based on the idea that three items or points create a sense of completeness and simplicity, making them easier to process and remember.
