# Principle of Commitment and Consistency

Getting users to make a small commitment and follow up on it can increase engagement with content.

Principle of Commitment means that once someone makes a choice or takes a small step towards a goal, they're more likely to continue in that direction. In design, this can be applied by getting users to make a small commitment, like signing up for a newsletter or creating an account. Once they do this, they've committed to your product or service and are more likely to keep using it.

Behavioural Consistency is about people's natural tendency to act in ways that are consistent with their previous actions and statements. In design, this means that if you can get users to take a small action that aligns with your product or service, they are more likely to continue behaving in a way that supports that initial action. For example, if a user indicates an interest in fitness by tracking a workout, they might be more likely to use your fitness app regularly.

In design, these principles suggest that if you can get people to make a small commitment or take an initial action that aligns with your product or service, they're more likely to continue using it and behaving in ways that are consistent with that initial choice. It's like getting your foot in the door, and once it's there, people tend to keep it there.
