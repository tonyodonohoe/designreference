# Three Pillars of User Delight

The Three Pillars of User Delight are a set of principles that help designers create products that users will love. These pillars are Visceral Delight, Behavioural Delight, and Reflective Delight.

* **Visceral Delight** is the feeling of joy that comes from experiencing something beautiful or well-crafted. It is the first impression that a user has when they see or touch a product. For example, a user might be delighted by the look and feel of a new smartphone.
* **Behavioural Delight** is the pleasure that comes from using a product that works well. It is the satisfaction that a user feels when they can easily accomplish their goals with minimal effort. For example, a user might be delighted by how quickly and smoothly they can navigate through an app.
* **Reflective Delight** is the feeling of happiness or satisfaction that comes after using a product. It is the sense of accomplishment or pride that a user feels when they have achieved their goals. For example, a user might be delighted by how much they have learned or accomplished after using an educational app.
