Prioritise tasks with the Impact-Effort Matrix. The Impact-Effort Matrix is a powerful tool for prioritising tasks or projects. By visually mapping tasks based on their impact and effort, you can quickly identify the highest-value, lowest-effort opportunities.

#### How it Works

1. **Identify Impact:** Determine the potential value or benefit of each task. High-impact tasks significantly contribute to your goals.
2. **Assess Effort:** Estimate the time, resources, and complexity required to complete each task. Low-effort tasks are relatively straightforward.
3. **Plot on the Matrix:** Position each task on a grid with impact on one axis and effort on the other.

#### Prioritisation Strategy

* **High-Impact, Low-Effort:** Focus on these tasks first. They offer significant returns with minimal investment.
* **High-Impact, High-Effort:** Consider these carefully, as they may require strategic planning and resource allocation.
* **Low-Impact, Low-Effort:** These tasks can often be delegated or deferred.
* **Low-Impact, High-Effort:** Re-evaluate these tasks to determine if they truly align with your priorities.

By strategically prioritising tasks, you can maximise productivity and achieve goals efficiently.
