# ICE Scoring

The ICE Scoring model evaluates features based on their Impact, Confidence, and Ease of implementation.&#x20;

This allows to focus on features that will have the most significant positive impact on both the user experience and business goals while balancing risk and effort. For example, a high-impact, low-effort feature would take precedence over a low-impact, high-effort one, ensuring that design resources are allocated effectively.
