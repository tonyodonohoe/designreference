# Eisenhower Matrix

The Eisenhower Matrix is a four-square grid decision-making tool that prioritises tasks based on their urgency and importance.

|               | Urgent                                         | Not Urgent                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Important     | <p>Do<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-</p>                  | <p>Schedule<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-</p> |
| Not Important | <p>Delegate / Postpone<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-</p> | <p>Don't Do<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-</p> |

#### 1. Urgent and important

* Do them.
* These are the tasks you need to focus on first.
* Tasks that demand immediate attention.

#### 2. Important but not urgent

* Schedule them.
* These are the tasks you should schedule for later.

#### 3. Urgent but not important

* Delegate them.
* These are tasks you should try and delegate to someone else.

#### 4. Not urgent and not important

* Don't do them.
* These are tasks you should eliminate altogether.
