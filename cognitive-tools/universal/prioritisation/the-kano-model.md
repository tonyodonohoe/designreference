# The Kano Model

The Kano Model helps prioritise features based on their impact on customer satisfaction. By categorising features as basic, performance, or excitement attributes, the Kano Model helps design teams focus on the elements that will create the most customer delight while ensuring that basic expectations are met. This is essential for balancing innovation with the need to deliver a user-friendly product.
