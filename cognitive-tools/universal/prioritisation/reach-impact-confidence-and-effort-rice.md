# Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort (RICE)

The RICE framework, which evaluates potential projects based on Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort, is a valuable tool in this process. It was created by Intercom as a prioritisation tool for product managers to help their own product teams make more informed decisions about which projects to focus on.

RICE ensures that teams focus on high-value jobs that contribute the most to the product's success and align with business priorities. For instance, a feature with high reach and impact but low effort would be prioritised over a high-effort, low-impact project, aligning with both product and organisational goals.

In short, RICE is a prioritisation framework used in product management and decision-making. It helps evaluate and prioritise initiatives based on their potential reach, impact, confidence level, and the effort required to implement them. RICE enables teams to focus on high-value initiatives and make informed choices based on data and analysis.
