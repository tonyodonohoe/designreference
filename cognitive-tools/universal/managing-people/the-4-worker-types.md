# 4 Worker Types

This framework classifies workers into four categories:

* **Pioneers**: Innovators who love new challenges and are quick to embrace change.
* **Guardians**: Risk-averse individuals who value stability, order, and process.
* **Drivers**: Focused on results and execution, Drivers excel in high-pressure environments.
* **Integrators**: Team-oriented individuals who prioritise relationships and collaboration.

Understanding these types can help teams work more effectively by recognising the strengths and motivations of each type.
