# 9 Employee Types

In December 2015 Sean Graber one of the co-founders of Virtuali, wrote and article for Harvard Business Review called "[The Two Sides of Employee Engagement](https://hbr.org/2015/12/the-two-sides-of-employee-engagement)" in which he identified "9 Employee Engagement Archetypes" which categorised employees based on their perceptions of their jobs and their behaviours at work.&#x20;

The model provides a valuable framework for organisations to understand their employees' engagement levels and tailor their strategies accordingly.



1. **All-Star**\
   Highly engaged, positive, and high-performing
2. **Workhorse**\
   Dedicated, hardworking, but potentially feeling undervalued or burned out.
3. **Brat**\
   Disengaged, negative, and resistant to change.
4. **Martyr**\
   Highly engaged, but suffering in silence due to heavy workload or lack of recognition.
5. **Saboteur**\
   Disengaged, destructive, and intentionally harming the company.
6. **Cynic**\
   Disengaged, negative, but not actively harming the company.
7. **Delinquent**\
   Disengaged, indifferent, and performing poorly.
8. **Drifter**\
   Disengaged, indifferent, and not actively harming or helping the company.
9. **Underachiever**\
   Disengaged, negative, but not actively harming the company.
