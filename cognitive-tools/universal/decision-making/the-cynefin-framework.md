The Cynefin (ke-nev-in) Framework is a valuable tool for understanding the nature of a situation and selecting the appropriate response. By recognising the domain of a situation, decision-makers can avoid common pitfalls, such as applying simple solutions to complex problems or overcomplicating straightforward issues.

The Cynefin Framework empowers individuals and organisations to make more informed and effective decisions and distinguishes between five domains:

1. **Clear**\
   In clear situations, cause and effect are obvious. Best practices and established procedures are sufficient to handle them.
2. **Complicated**\
   Complicated situations, while having known causes, offer multiple possible solutions. Experts can analyse the situation and determine the optimal course of action.
3. **Complex**\
   Complex situations lack clear cause-and-effect relationships. Experimentation and learning are essential to uncover underlying patterns and develop effective solutions.
4. **Chaotic**\
   Chaotic situations are characterised by high uncertainty and rapid change. Immediate action is necessary to stabilise the situation and prevent further deterioration.
5. **Disorder**\
   Disorder is the initial state of a situation, where its nature is unclear. Sense-making is required to categorise the situation into one of the other four domains.
