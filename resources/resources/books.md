A special thanks to [Jesmond Allen](https://x.com/jesmond) and [James Chudley](https://x.com/chudders) for making 'Smashing UX Design' freely available to the public [via PDF download](https://jameschudley.co.uk/2023/11/21/free-download-of-smashing-ux-design/). Initially published in 2012, this book quickly became a cornerstone resource for countless UX designers, myself included. After selling over 10,000 copies, it went out of print, causing second-hand copies to skyrocket to eye-watering prices, such was its demand. Despite being over a decade old, 'Smashing UX Design' is still well worth a read today, offering practical insights into UX design principles and practices. It covers a wide range of topics, such as user research, information architecture, interaction design, and usability testing.
