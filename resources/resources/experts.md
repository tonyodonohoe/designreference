#### The Decision Lab

The Decision Lab is an applied research and innovation firm that utilises behavioural science and design to assist ambitious organisations in creating a better future. This is achieved through the provision of consulting services to some of the largest organisations in the world, the execution of research in priority areas, and the management of one of the largest publications in applied behavioural science.

Past collaborations include work with organisations such as the Gates Foundation, Capital One, the World Bank, and numerous Fortune 500s to solve complex problems through scientific thinking.

Humans make approximately 35,000 decisions a day with a brain adapted to a significantly different environment than the modern world. Frequently, these decisions lead to unintended outcomes, creating limitations for individuals, organisations, and societies.

The Decision Lab aims to understand how decisions can be aligned with individual and collective goals. By leveraging insights from established fields like psychology and behavioural economics, as well as cutting-edge disciplines such as social physics and artificial intelligence, the firm works to understand and improve decision-making processes. The ultimate objective is the application of science to empower the global community.
