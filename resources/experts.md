## The Decision Lab

The Decision Lab is an applied research and innovation firm. We use behavioral science & design to help ambitious organizations create a better future. We do this by providing consulting services to some of the largest organizations in the world, carrying out research in priority areas, and running one of the largest publications in applied behavioral science. In the past, we have helped organizations such as the Gates Foundation, Capital One, the World Bank and numerous Fortune 500s solve some of their thorniest problems using scientific thinking.

We make 35,000 decisions a day with a brain adapted to a very different world from the one we live in today. Unsurprisingly, many of our decisions lead to outcomes we don’t want. This can limit us as individuals, organizations and societies. At The Decision Lab, our goal is to understand how decisions can be aligned with what we individually and collectively want to achieve. We use insights from a variety of fields – from well established ones such as psychology and behavioral economics, to cutting edge ones such as social physics and artificial intelligence – to understand and improve decisions. Our goal is to use science to empower the world.
