# A/B Testing

AKA Split Testing
{% endhint %}

A/B testing is a straightforward way to compare two different versions of a design to see which one performs better. In this method, you create a version A, which is usually the current design, and a version B, which includes one specific change, such as a different colour for a button or a new headline. These two versions are shown to different groups of users at the same time. By tracking how each group interacts with the page, you can see which version leads to more clicks, signups, or sales.

The main benefit of this approach is that it takes the guesswork out of design decisions. Instead of relying on a personal preference or a hunch, you use actual data from real users to guide your choices. It allows you to make small, incremental improvements to a website or an app over time. Because you only change one element at a time, you can be confident that the specific change you made was the reason for any improvement in user behaviour.

This method is particularly useful for fine-tuning the details of a user experience once the basic structure is in place. It helps you understand what resonates most with your audience and ensures that your design choices are helping you reach your goals. By constantly testing and learning, you can build a more effective and user-friendly product that is based on evidence rather than assumptions.
