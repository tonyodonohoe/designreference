# A/B Testing

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a user testing technique where two versions of a webpage or design (A and B) are compared to determine which performs better in terms of user engagement or desired outcomes. Participants are randomly assigned to either version and their interactions and responses are measured. A/B testing helps evaluate the impact of different design elements, layouts, or content variations, allowing designers and researchers to make data-driven decisions and optimize the user experience based on the most effective version.
