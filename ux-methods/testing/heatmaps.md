# Heatmaps

Heatmaps are visual representations that use colours to display data. They track user actions like mouse movements, clicks, and scrolling to identify hotspots (high activity) and coldspots (low activity) on a webpage. Heatmaps help designers and researchers analyse user behaviour, identify patterns, and make informed decisions to improve the user experience.
