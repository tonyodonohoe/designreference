Instead of testing with users, experts in usability or design evaluate your prototype against established usability principles and best practices. They provide feedback based on their expertise and experience.

### **Heuristic Evaluation**

Heuristic analysis, also known as a heuristic evaluation, is a method used to assess the usability and user experience of a digital product or interface. It involves a systematic review by experts who evaluate the design based on a set of predefined usability principles or heuristics. These heuristics are guidelines that help identify potential usability issues or areas for improvement. The evaluators examine the interface, interactions, and overall user flow to determine how well the design aligns with these principles. Heuristic analysis provides valuable feedback and recommendations for enhancing the user experience, improving usability, and identifying any potential obstacles or challenges that users may encounter while interacting with the product or interface.

### Design Audits

A design audit often includes a heuristic evaluation as one of its components. Expert reviews can incorporate elements of heuristic evaluation, but they are not strictly bound by the predefined heuristics. Design audit is the broadest, covering multiple aspects of the user experience. Expert review is focused on usability and user experience, drawing on the evaluator's expertise. Heuristic evaluation is specifically focused on usability and uses predefined principles.

### Cognitive Walkthrough

In this approach, testers simulate users' thinking processes as they interact with your prototype. They evaluate how easily users can accomplish tasks and identify potential cognitive obstacles or points of confusion.

### Think-Aloud Evaluation

During this method, users verbalise their thoughts and actions as they interact with the prototype. This provides insights into their decision-making processes, problem-solving strategies, and any difficulties they encounter.

### Accessibility Evaluation

This method focuses on evaluating the accessibility of your prototype for users with disabilities. Testers with relevant disabilities interact with the prototype and provide feedback on its usability and accessibility features.
