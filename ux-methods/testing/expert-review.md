Instead of testing with users, experts in usability or design evaluate your prototype, product or service against established usability principles and best practices. They provide feedback based on their expertise and experience.

#### **Heuristic Evaluation**

Heuristic Analysis, also known as a Heuristic Evaluation, is a method used to assess the usability and user experience of a digital product or interface. It involves a systematic review by experts who evaluate the design based on a set of predefined usability principles or heuristics.&#x20;

These heuristics are guidelines that help identify potential usability issues or areas for improvement. The evaluators examine the interface, interactions, and overall user flow to determine how well the design aligns with these principles.&#x20;

Heuristic Analysis provides valuable feedback and recommendations for enhancing the user experience, improving usability, and identifying any potential obstacles or challenges that users may encounter while interacting with the product or interface.

#### Design Audits

A Design Audit often includes a Heuristic Evaluation as one of its components. Expert Reviews can incorporate elements of Heuristic Evaluation, but they are not strictly bound by the predefined heuristics.&#x20;

Design Audit is the broadest, covering multiple aspects of the user experience. Expert Review is focused on usability and user experience, drawing on the evaluator's expertise. Heuristic Evaluation is specifically focused on usability and uses predefined principles.

#### Cognitive Walkthrough

A Cognitive Walkthrough is a specialised type of Expert Review where an evaluator simulates a user’s thought process to determine how easy it is to learn a new system. Unlike a general review, this method focuses specifically on new or infrequent users who are trying to complete a task for the first time without any formal training. The expert goes through each step of a task and asks a series of specific questions to see if the design provides enough clues for a person to reach their goal successfully.

During the walkthrough, the reviewer looks at the interface and asks if the user will naturally try to achieve the right effect and if they will notice that the correct control is available. They also check if the user will understand that the button or menu they see is the one they actually need for their specific task. Finally, after an action is taken, the expert evaluates whether the system provides clear feedback so the user knows they are moving in the right direction.

This method is incredibly useful early in the design phase because it identifies "guessing points" where a user might get stuck or take a wrong turn. By looking at the interface through the eyes of a beginner, an expert can spot where labels are confusing or where the logical flow of a process breaks down. It ensures that the product is intuitive and that the visual cues provided by the designers are strong enough to guide a person to success without any outside help.

#### Task Analysis

Task analysis is a focused method used during an expert review to break down exactly how a user completes a specific goal within a system. Instead of looking at the design as a whole, an expert examines the individual steps a person must take to finish a task, such as purchasing an item or signing up for a newsletter. By mapping out these actions, the reviewer can see where the process is logical and where it becomes unnecessarily difficult or repetitive for the user.

This process helps to identify the mental effort required to use a product. When an expert performs a task analysis, they look for "friction points" where a user might get confused or where the system asks for too much information at once. By understanding the sequence of events from the user's perspective, the reviewer can recommend ways to simplify the journey, such as combining steps or removing distractions that do not help reach the final goal.

In the context of an expert review, task analysis ensures that the functional side of the design matches the user's real world needs. It allows the team to see if the interface supports the way people naturally think and work. By stripping the experience down to its core actions, designers can create a more efficient and streamlined path, ensuring that the most frequent tasks are the easiest ones to complete.

#### Accessibility Evaluation

This method focuses on evaluating the accessibility of your prototype for users with disabilities. Testers with relevant disabilities interact with the prototype and provide feedback on its usability and accessibility features.
