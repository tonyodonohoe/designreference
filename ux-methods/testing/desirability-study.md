# Desirability Study

A Desirability Study is a research method used to understand if users find a product, feature, or design aesthetically pleasing, emotionally engaging, and appealing.

Unlike Usability Testing, which focuses on "can the user accomplish a task?" (e.g., "Can you find the 'add to cart' button?"), a desirability study asks "how do users _feel_ about this design?" It digs into the emotional and psychological side of the user experience.

The core idea is that a product's success isn't just about functionality, it's also about its emotional connection with the user. A perfectly functional product might fail if it doesn't evoke the right feelings, while a less functional but more desirable product might succeed.

#### How a Desirability Study is Conducted

A common way to run a desirability study is by using a method often referred to as the Microsoft Desirability Toolkit or Product Reaction Cards.

1. **Preparation:** The team creates or selects a set of descriptive adjective cards (e.g., "fun," "professional," "trustworthy," "boring," "complicated," "innovative").
2. **User Interaction:** Participants are shown different design mock-ups, prototypes, or even live products.
3. **Card Sorting:** After seeing a design, participants are asked to sort through the adjective cards and choose the ones that best describe how the design makes them feel. They might also be asked to pick cards that describe a competitor's design for comparison.
4. **Discussion:** The researcher then asks the participant to explain _why_ they chose those specific cards. This qualitative feedback provides crucial context and insights.

#### Why It's Important

* **Goes Beyond Usability:** It fills in the blanks that usability testing can't, revealing if a design is not just easy to use, but also a joy to use.
* **Guides Visual Design:** It helps a team understand if their visual design choices (colour, typography, layout) are conveying the intended brand attributes and emotional responses.
* **Informs Branding:** It's a key tool for ensuring a product's design aligns with the company's brand identity and emotional goals.
* **Helps with Prioritisation:** By understanding what aspects of a design are most desirable, a team can better prioritize improvements and new features that will have the biggest emotional impact.
