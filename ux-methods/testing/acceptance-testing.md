# Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing is the final stage of the development process where a product is checked to ensure it meets all the requirements and is ready for real users. In this phase, the focus shifts away from finding small technical bugs and toward verifying that the software actually does what it was designed to do. It acts as a formal review where stakeholders or end users test the system in a realistic environment to confirm it solves the specific problems it was built to address.

There are generally two main types of this method known as alpha and beta testing. Alpha testing is usually done by internal staff who look for any remaining issues before the product leaves the building. Beta testing follows this by giving a nearly finished version to a small group of actual customers. Their feedback provides an honest look at how the product performs in the wild, helping the team catch any overlooked frustrations before the official launch.

Ultimately, the goal of acceptance testing is to provide confidence to the business and the developers. Passing these tests signifies that the product is "good enough" to be released and that it delivers the expected value. By involving the people who will actually use or pay for the tool, the team ensures they haven't just built a working piece of software, but the right piece of software for the audience's needs.
