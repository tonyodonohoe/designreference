# Usability Testing

### **1. Introduction**

Usability testing is a method of evaluating how easily users can interact with a product, such as a website, app, or software. Through observing real users as they attempt to complete tasks, usability testing aims to identify areas where users encounter difficulties, enabling the team to refine the product and improve the overall user experience.

In the design and development process, usability testing helps ensure that products are not only functional but intuitive and enjoyable for the end-user.

### **2. Why**

Conducting usability testing has several important benefits:

* **Enhances User Experience**: By identifying pain points early, teams can design with the user’s ease and satisfaction in mind.
* **Reduces Development Costs**: Catching issues in the design phase saves time and resources that might otherwise be spent on extensive revisions post-launch.
* **Validates Design Choices**: Real user feedback can highlight the practical impact of design decisions, ensuring they meet the needs and preferences of the target audience.

Usability testing differs from A/B testing, which compares two versions to see which performs better. It also differs from functional testing, which ensures that product features work as intended but does not evaluate user ease or satisfaction.

### **3. Types of Usability Testing**

**Moderated vs. Unmoderated Testing**

* **Moderated**: A facilitator guides the user through the test, either in person or remotely. Best for obtaining deep, qualitative insights.
* **Unmoderated**: Users complete tasks independently, often through an online tool, offering flexibility and cost efficiency for larger samples.

**Remote vs. In-Person Testing**

* **Remote**: Convenient for diverse audiences, with the ability to record sessions and analyse broader, more natural interactions.
* **In-Person**: Allows for direct observation and nuanced feedback but may require more resources to organise.

**Guerrilla Testing**

* Quick, low-cost tests typically conducted in public spaces or on-the-go, useful for gaining immediate feedback on a new feature or idea.

**Think-Aloud Protocol**

* Users verbalise their thoughts while interacting with the product, giving insight into their thought processes, expectations, and frustrations.

**Eye-Tracking Testing**

* Tracks user gaze patterns, useful for understanding visual hierarchy and attention focus in product interfaces.

**Session Replay Analysis**

* Records and replays user interactions to identify patterns, usability issues, and pain points retrospectively.

### **4. Usability Testing Process**

**Planning**

* Define clear objectives: What do you hope to learn?
* Select tasks that represent key product functions.
* Set success criteria and metrics for performance, such as task completion rates, error rates, and time-on-task.

**Recruiting Participants**

* Identify the target user profile to ensure meaningful insights.
* Recruit participants who match the intended audience using internal resources or recruitment platforms.
* Aim for at least 5-10 users to identify core issues.

**Conducting the Test**

* Establish a neutral environment where participants feel comfortable.
* Guide users through each task without leading their responses.
* Observe and take notes, focusing on body language, hesitations, and expressions.

**Collecting Data**

* Gather both **qualitative data** (observations, user quotes) and **quantitative data** (task completion rate, error rate).
* Use tools to record sessions for deeper post-session analysis.

**Analysing and Reporting**

* Identify patterns in user behaviour, frustrations, and expectations.
* Summarise findings with actionable recommendations for each issue, prioritising those that impact usability most.
* Share insights with stakeholders, along with examples of user interactions to highlight key issues.

### **5. Techniques & Tools**

Many tools make usability testing easier to conduct and analyse:

* **UserTesting**: Allows for both moderated and unmoderated testing, suitable for gathering video-based feedback from remote users.
* **Maze**: Rapid, unmoderated testing tool with heatmaps and metrics for task performance.
* **Lookback**: Enables both moderated and unmoderated testing, with features to record live interactions.
* **Hotjar**: Ideal for session replays, click heatmaps, and basic behavioural analytics on live products.

Choosing the right tool depends on the budget, scale, and specific goals of the usability testing session.

### **6. Best Practices**

* **Stay Neutral**: Avoid leading questions and allow users to express themselves without influence.
* **Create Realistic, Actionable Tasks**: Design tasks that are representative of real-life product interactions.
* **Focus on Reliability**: Use a structured testing plan to keep sessions consistent and avoid bias.
* **Integrate with Agile or Lean**: For Agile teams, conduct lightweight, frequent usability tests, incorporating insights directly into sprints.

### **7. Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them**

* **Bias in Testing**: Ensure questions and task prompts are neutral. Having multiple facilitators can help avoid a single-source bias.
* **Recruitment Errors**: Recruit users who reflect the real user base and avoid too small or homogeneous a sample.
* **Misaligned Goals**: Match testing tasks to core goals. Avoid testing elements that aren’t ready or relevant, as this can lead to confusing results.
