# Surveys

Surveys are research tools used to collect data and feedback from users regarding their opinions, preferences, and experiences with a product or service.

Surveys typically involve a series of structured questions that users respond to, providing quantitative or qualitative data. The questions can cover various aspects, such as user satisfaction, usability, feature preferences, or demographic information. User surveys are administered through online platforms, email, or in-person interactions.

They allow designers and researchers to gather insights directly from users, understand their needs and expectations, and identify areas for improvement.

Surveys can help validate hypotheses, measure user satisfaction, and inform design decisions. By analysing survey responses, organisations can gain valuable insights into user preferences and make data-driven decisions to enhance their product or service. User surveys provide a scalable and efficient means of gathering feedback, enabling organisations to make informed improvements and iterate on their offerings.
