# Usability Testing Platforms

Usability testing platforms are tools or software applications that facilitate the evaluation and assessment of a product's usability by users. These platforms provide features for creating and conducting usability tests, recording user interactions, capturing feedback, and analysing test results. They help designers and researchers gather insights on how users interact with a product, identify usability issues, and make informed design decisions to improve the overall user experience.
