# RITE Testing

#### RITE Testing: Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation

The RITE method is a high-speed approach to usability testing where the design is updated as soon as a problem is identified and a solution is agreed upon. Unlike traditional usability testing, which waits for a full cohort of participants to finish before making changes, RITE focuses on immediate evolution. This makes it particularly effective for fast-moving environments, such as AI-driven product development, where user interactions are often unpredictable.

**Core Philosophy**

The method operates on a simple cycle: find a problem, fix it, and test it again immediately. By iterating after as few as one or two participants, the team avoids wasting subsequent sessions on known issues that have already been diagnosed. This ensures that testing time is always spent uncovering new or more nuanced problems rather than confirming what is already broken.

#### How It Works

1. **Preparation:** Create a flexible prototype that can be edited quickly. This is often easier with high-fidelity design tools or modular components rather than production code.
2. **The Session:** A participant attempts a task while the core team—including designers, researchers, and product managers—observes the session in real time.
3. **Immediate Triage:** After the session, the team holds a brief sync to categorise any issues. If a problem is clear and the solution is obvious, the designer updates the prototype before the next participant begins.
4. **Verification:** The new design is tested with the next user. If the issue is resolved, the team moves on to the next challenge; if not, they continue to refine the solution.

#### When to Use RITE

This approach is best suited for the early stages of a feature or when dealing with complex, non-linear workflows like AI chat interfaces. It requires a dedicated team that can commit to several hours or days of continuous observation and design. Because the prototype changes constantly, RITE is less about gathering statistical data and more about rapidly arriving at a highly polished, functional user experience.

#### Success Factors

For RITE to be successful, the team must have the authority to make design decisions on the fly. It also requires a mindset shift: the goal is not to prove that the current design works, but to find every reason why it might fail and correct it before the product reaches the engineering phase. This collaborative intensity builds strong alignment across the team, as everyone witnesses the user's struggle and the subsequent fix firsthand.
