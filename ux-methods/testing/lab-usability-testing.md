# Lab Usability Testing

Lab usability testing involves participants using a computer or mobile device while being observed by a trained moderator in a special laboratory. The moderator watches their interactions, asks questions, and responds to their feedback in real-time. The laboratory has two rooms separated by a one-way mirror, allowing observers to take notes and watch without being seen. The sessions can be recorded for further analysis. Lab usability testing gives detailed information about how users experience your product, providing qualitative insights into their behaviors, motivations, and attitudes. However, it can be costly and time-consuming, requiring a dedicated environment, participants, and a moderator. It also involves a small number of participants in a controlled setting, which may not represent your entire user base. Lab usability testing is best suited when you want comprehensive and in-depth feedback from participants.
