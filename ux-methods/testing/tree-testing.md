# Tree Testing

Tree testing is a specialised research method used to evaluate how easily people can find information within a website or app's navigation structure. Unlike other tests that look at colours or images, tree testing strips away all visual design elements to focus purely on the labels and the hierarchy of the content. This allows researchers to see if the underlying organisation of the site makes sense to users without them being distracted or helped by icons, search bars, or clever layouts.

During a session, a participant is given a specific task, such as finding a particular policy document or a product category, and asked to navigate through a text-only version of the site map. They click through the different levels of the "tree" until they believe they have reached the correct destination. The researcher then tracks whether the user found the item, how long it took them, and which paths led them astray. This data is invaluable for identifying exactly where a navigation menu becomes confusing or where certain labels are misinterpreted.

By conducting these tests early in the design process, teams can fix structural issues before any expensive visual design or coding begins. It provides a clear, data-driven way to prove whether a proposed navigation system is intuitive or if it needs to be reorganised. The result is a more user-friendly experience where people can find what they need quickly and with minimal frustration. Because the test is so focused, it is one of the most effective ways to ensure that the logic of a digital product matches the mental model of its users.
