# Measuring Design Success

Measuring design success is the process of using specific data to determine if a product actually works for the people using it. Instead of relying on personal opinions or how a screen looks, this method focuses on clear evidence. It bridges the gap between creative choices and business goals by looking at how easily users can complete tasks and how satisfied they feel afterward.

To do this effectively, you need to choose the right metrics before you begin testing. Common indicators include how long a person takes to finish a goal, the number of mistakes they make, or their overall rating of the experience. By tracking these numbers over time, you can see if your design changes are making the product better or if new problems have been introduced that need to be fixed.

The ultimate goal of this method is to prove the value of your work with hard facts. When you can show that a redesign reduced customer errors or increased completion rates, you move beyond guesswork. This approach ensures that the design team and the stakeholders are aligned on what "good" looks like, making it much easier to decide where to focus your energy next.
