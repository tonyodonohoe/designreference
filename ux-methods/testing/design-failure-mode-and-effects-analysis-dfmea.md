# Design Failure Mode & Effects Analysis (DFMEA)

Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, or DFMEA, is a systematic approach used by design teams to identify potential problems in a product before they actually happen. Instead of waiting for a user to encounter an error, this method encourages the team to look at every component or feature and ask what could possibly go wrong. By predicting these failures early, designers can build in safeguards or change the layout to prevent frustration, injury, or system crashes later on.

During this process, each potential failure is usually scored based on three factors: how serious the impact would be, how often it is likely to occur, and how easy it is to detect before it reaches the user. This scoring helps the team prioritise which issues are the most critical to fix immediately and which ones are minor inconveniences. It turns a chaotic guessing game into a structured list of action items, ensuring that the most dangerous or annoying flaws are addressed first.

Using this method is especially important for complex systems or products where safety and reliability are paramount. It moves the design process from being reactive to being proactive, which saves a significant amount of time and money in the long run. By documenting these risks and the steps taken to mitigate them, the team creates a more robust and trustworthy user experience that feels seamless and well thought out.
