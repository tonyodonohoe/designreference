# First Click Testing

First click testing is a specific usability method used to find out if the very first action a user takes on a website or app is the correct one. Research has shown that if a person gets their first click right, they are much more likely to complete their entire task successfully. This test is usually performed by giving a participant a scenario, such as "find where to change your account password," and then recording exactly where they click on a static image of the interface.

The results of this test provide clear data on whether your navigation and labels are as intuitive as you think they are. Because it focuses only on that initial moment of decision, it strips away the noise of a user wandering around a site and getting lucky. If a large number of people click on the wrong area, it is a strong signal that your visual hierarchy is misleading or that your buttons are not placed where users naturally expect to find them.

This method is incredibly efficient because it can be done with simple wireframes or even rough sketches before any code is written. It helps design teams settle arguments about layout by providing objective evidence of user behaviour. By ensuring the first step is easy and obvious, you can significantly reduce user frustration and help people move through your product with much more confidence and speed.
