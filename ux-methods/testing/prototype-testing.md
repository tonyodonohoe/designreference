# Prototype Testing

Prototype testing involves creating early, simplified versions of a product or interface to gather user feedback. These prototypes are not the final product but serve as a tangible representation for testing. It helps designers understand how users interact with the design and identify potential issues or improvements before investing in full development. During prototype testing, designers observe and gather user reactions, preferences, and pain points. Users can interact with the prototype, providing valuable insights on usability and functionality. This iterative process allows for quick adjustments and refinements based on user input. Prototype testing aids in refining the user experience, ensuring the final product aligns with user expectations and needs. It saves time and resources by identifying and addressing problems early in the design phase, ultimately resulting in a more user-friendly and effective end product.
