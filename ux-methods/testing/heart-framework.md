# Heart Framework

The HEART framework is a high-level system created by researchers at Google to help teams measure the quality of the user experience on a large scale.&#x20;

Unlike simple metrics that only look at how many people visit a website, this method focuses on the specific emotional and behavioural aspects of how users interact with a product. It allows designers and product managers to choose the right data points to track, ensuring that they are measuring what actually matters for long-term success rather than just vanity numbers.

The name itself is an acronym for five key categories:&#x20;

1. Happiness
2. Engagement
3. Adoption
4. Retention
5. Task Success

Happiness measures user satisfaction through surveys or ratings, while Engagement looks at how often and how deeply people use the product. Adoption and Retention track how many new users start using a feature and how many of them keep coming back over time. Finally, Task Success focuses on the efficiency and effectiveness of the design, such as how long it takes a person to complete a specific action or how many errors they make along the way.

To make this framework practical, teams typically define specific goals, signals, and metrics for each of the five categories. For example, a goal for Happiness might be that users find the app easy to use, the signal would be positive ratings in the app store, and the metric would be the average star rating over a month. This structured approach helps a team stay aligned and provides a clear, data-driven story about whether their design changes are truly improving the lives of their users.
