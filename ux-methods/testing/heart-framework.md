# Heart Framework

The HEART framework, developed by Google, is a methodology for measuring and improving the UX of digital products. It focuses on five key metrics:

1. Happiness
2. Engagement
3. Adoption
4. Retention, and
5. Task success

By tracking these metrics, teams can gain insights into how well their product is performing and identify areas for improvement, leading to data-driven decisions to enhance the user experience and achieve business goals.
