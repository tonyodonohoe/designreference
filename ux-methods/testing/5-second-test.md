# 5 Second Test

The 5 Second Test is a user testing technique that involves showing participants a webpage or design for just five seconds. After the time elapses, participants are asked questions about their initial impressions, what they remember, or key elements they noticed. This test helps assess the clarity and effectiveness of visual elements, messaging, and overall user experience in a brief timeframe.
