# Screen Recording Analysis

Screen Recording Analysis is a qualitative research method where researchers watch back videos of users interacting with a digital product in their natural environment or during a specific task. Unlike moderated testing, this approach allows you to see exactly how a person navigates a website or app without the pressure of an observer watching them in real time. It captures every mouse movement, hover, click, and moment of hesitation, providing a clear picture of the actual user journey.

By reviewing these recordings, you can identify specific points of friction that might not be captured by heatmaps or survey data. You might notice a user repeatedly clicking a non-functional element or scrolling past a crucial call to action because it failed to grab their attention. This method is particularly useful for spotting bugs, understanding how different device types affect the experience, and witnessing the "why" behind high drop-off rates on certain pages.

The primary goal of this analysis is to turn raw observation into actionable improvements. Researchers look for patterns in behaviour across multiple sessions to determine if an issue is an isolated incident or a widespread usability flaw. Because you are observing unscripted behaviour, the insights gathered are often more authentic than those found in a lab setting, making it an essential tool for refining the user interface and ensuring the final product is as intuitive as possible.
