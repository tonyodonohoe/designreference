# Beta Testing

Beta testing is the stage where a product is tested by a select group of external users before its official release. It aims to gather real-world feedback, identify issues, and evaluate the product's performance, functionality, and usability. Beta testing helps refine the product based on user input before it reaches the wider audience.
