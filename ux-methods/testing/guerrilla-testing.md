# Guerrilla Testing

Guerrilla testing is a fast and low cost way to get feedback on a design by taking it out into the real world and asking random people for their thoughts. Instead of recruiting specific participants and scheduling formal sessions in a lab, a researcher might go to a public place like a coffee shop or a library. They approach people who are not busy and ask them to spend a few minutes trying out a website or an app on a laptop or mobile device in exchange for a small gesture, like buying them a drink.

The main goal of this approach is to quickly identify "showstopper" usability flaws that would frustrate almost anyone. Because the people being tested are not experts and have no prior knowledge of the project, their reactions are honest and unbiased. This method is perfect for the early stages of a design when you need to know if a basic concept makes sense before you spend too much time or money developing it further. It allows a team to move fast and make changes based on real human behaviour rather than just guessing.

While it is not a replacement for deep research with a specific target audience, guerrilla testing is incredibly effective for checking general clarity and ease of use. It helps you see if your buttons are easy to find and if your instructions are simple enough for a stranger to understand. By stepping out of the office and talking to the public, you can break out of the "designer bubble" and ensure your product works for people in the real world.
