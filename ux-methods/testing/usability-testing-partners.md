# Usability Testing Partners

Working with usability testing partners involves collaborating with external specialists or agencies to evaluate how easily people can use your product. These partners bring a high level of expertise and objectivity to the research process, which helps to eliminate the natural bias that often occurs when internal teams test their own designs. They typically handle the more complex and time-consuming aspects of a study, such as finding the right participants from specific target groups and setting up professional testing environments.

Using an external partner is particularly helpful when you need to scale your research quickly or reach a very niche audience that is difficult to find on your own. These experts use various techniques, such as moderated interviews or unmoderated remote sessions, to gather deep insights into user behaviour. Because they are not involved in the daily development of the product, they can offer a fresh perspective and identify friction points or confusing navigation that your team might have overlooked.

Ultimately, the goal of this collaboration is to receive a detailed and impartial analysis of the user experience. A testing partner will provide clear, evidence-based recommendations and highlight the most critical issues that need to be fixed before a launch. This partnership allows your internal team to focus on implementing improvements and building features, while the experts ensure that every design decision is validated by real feedback from actual users.
