# Hallway Testing

Hallway testing is an informal and spontaneous usability method used to get quick feedback on a design by asking nearby colleagues who are not involved in the project to try it out. The name comes from the idea of literally stopping someone walking down the hallway to ask for five or ten minutes of their time. It is a highly effective way to find obvious flaws or confusing labels without the need for a formal laboratory setup or a long recruitment process for outside participants.

The main advantage of this approach is its speed and lack of cost. Because the testers are often just a few desks away, a designer can test a new idea or a specific button placement several times in a single afternoon. While these colleagues might work for the same company, if they are not part of the immediate design or development team, they can still provide a fresh perspective. They can quickly point out if a sentence is hard to read or if a navigation menu does not lead where they expected it to.

This method is particularly useful during the middle stages of a project when you need a "sanity check" on a specific feature. It helps the team stay grounded and ensures that the interface is not becoming too complex for a general user to understand. By catching simple mistakes early through these quick interactions, the team can refine the product continuously, making the eventual formal testing with real customers much more productive and focused on deeper issues.
