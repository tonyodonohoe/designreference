# Diary Studies

Diary studies involve gathering data by asking participants to keep a record or diary of their experiences, behaviours, or thoughts over a specific period. Participants document their daily activities, thoughts, or interactions in a structured or unstructured format, providing detailed insights into their lives. Researchers use diary studies to gain a deeper understanding of participants' perspectives, habits, and challenges over time. These studies help uncover patterns, preferences, and motivations in a natural and self-reported manner, enabling businesses to tailor their offerings and improve user experiences based on real-life observations.
