# User Mental Models

User mental models refer to the cognitive frameworks or structures that individuals use to understand and interpret the world around them.&#x20;

These models are personal constructs that shape how people perceive, reason, and make decisions. Mental models are built through experiences, knowledge, beliefs, and cultural influences. They act as filters through which individuals interpret and navigate their environment. Understanding mental models is crucial in design and user experience as it allows designers to align their products or services with users' existing mental frameworks.&#x20;

By considering users' mental models, designers can create intuitive interfaces, anticipate user expectations, and provide seamless experiences. Incorporating mental models in design helps bridge the gap between the system's functionality and users' mental representation, resulting in products that are easier to understand, learn, and use.
