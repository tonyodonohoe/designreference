User flows, flow diagrams or flowcharts, illustrate the path a user takes through a system or website to accomplish a specific task or goal. These visual representations depict the sequence of steps, decisions, and interactions that a user experiences while navigating the interface. User flows use symbols and connectors to demonstrate the flow of information and actions between different screens, pages, or components. They help designers and stakeholders understand the logical progression of user interactions and identify potential bottlenecks or opportunities for improvement. User flows provide a visual roadmap of the user journey, highlighting the key touchpoints and decision points along the way. They assist in designing intuitive and seamless experiences, ensuring that users can accomplish their goals efficiently and effectively. User flows serve as a valuable communication and documentation tool, facilitating collaboration among designers, developers, and stakeholders throughout the design process.
