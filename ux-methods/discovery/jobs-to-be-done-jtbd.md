#### What is the Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework?

The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework helps businesses understand the underlying "job" or "task" that customers are trying to accomplish when they use a product or service. Instead of focusing on product features, JTBD shifts attention to the customer’s end goals, ensuring better alignment with their actual needs.

By uncovering the reasons users choose a product or feature, JTBD empowers teams to identify the essential "job" users want to fulfil and develop products that address these needs more effectively than alternatives. This approach guides product teams to prioritise customer outcomes, shaping design and development around solving real problems and delivering meaningful results.

JTBD is particularly valuable for long-term strategy, as it keeps teams focused on what users genuinely value rather than fixating on specific solutions or features. This outcome-oriented perspective helps organisations build products that meet core customer needs and stand the test of time.

#### Does JTBD Fit Under Strategy or Process?

* **Strategic Role**: JTBD is often viewed as a strategic framework because it drives high-level decisions about product direction and customer focus. By understanding customer jobs, organisations can develop products that directly support core customer goals.
* **Process Integration**: While strategic, JTBD can also influence process by embedding job-focused thinking into the product development lifecycle (e.g., discovery, prototyping, and iteration stages).

#### Key Aspects of the JTBD Framework

1. **Understanding Customer Needs**\
   By concentrating on the job that a customer wants to get done, businesses can better understand the specific problems customers face and what they hope to achieve. This knowledge enables the development of solutions that truly address customer needs.
2. **Developing Relevant Products**\
   JTBD guides product development by encouraging a focus on creating solutions that directly fulfill customer goals, leading to products that are more likely to meet their expectations and solve their problems.
3. **Effective Marketing Alignment**\
   By emphasising the job customers need to accomplish, JTBD helps businesses communicate the product's value in a way that resonates with customers, showing how the product can effectively help them achieve their goals.

#### Types of Jobs in the JTBD Framework

* **Functional Jobs**: These are the primary tasks a customer wants to accomplish, such as “find a secure way to store files.”
* **Emotional Jobs**: The feelings or perceptions customers want to achieve, e.g., feeling safe, avoiding anxiety, or gaining confidence.
* **Social Jobs**: These relate to how a customer wants to be perceived by others, such as “appear professional in client meetings.”
* **Supporting Jobs**: Related or secondary tasks that complement the main job (e.g., “easily share files with colleagues”).

#### Tips for Implementing the JTBD Framework

* **Keep the Focus on Customer Goals**: Shift perspective from product features to the “why” behind customer actions.
* **Use Interviews and Observations**: Customer research should focus on the underlying reasons customers choose your product, rather than preferences for specific features.
* **Look Beyond Demographics**: Demographic data is often not predictive of customer jobs. Instead, focus on situational context.
* **Incorporate Cross-Functional Teams**: JTBD insights can benefit from perspectives across product, design, marketing, and customer support teams.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing the JTBD Framework

1. **Research and Identify Jobs**
   * Conduct user interviews or observe users in action to understand their end goals.
   * Focus on specific language and phrasing used by users, as this can reveal deeper insights.
2. **Define Job Statements**
   * Write clear statements using a structure like: "When \[situation], I want to \[job], so I can \[outcome]."
   * When I'm planning a new project, I want to organise tasks and deadlines, so I can ensure my team stays on schedule and on budget.
   * When I'm working out at home, I want to follow guided exercise routines, so I can stay motivated and improve my fitness without needing a gym.
   * When I get home from work, I want to have a quick and easy meal kit to prepare, so I can eat a nutritious dinner without spending too much time cooking.
   * When I have free time, I want to learn new professional skills, so I can improve my qualifications and advance my career.
   * When I check my finances, I want to see a summary of my spending and saving, so I can make informed decisions and work toward my financial goals.
   * Ensure job statements capture both functional and emotional goals where relevant.
3. **Categorise and Prioritise Jobs**
   * Organise jobs by relevance, frequency, and importance.
   * Work with stakeholders to prioritise the top jobs to address based on strategic alignment and potential impact.
4. **Translate Jobs into Features and Processes**
   * Break down each job into requirements and features.
   * Example: If users “hire” the product to align on project milestones, features like reminders, shared notes, and real-time project updates might be valuable.
5. **Test and Iterate**
   * Continuously test with real users to ensure the features fulfil the job in the best way possible.
   * Collect feedback on whether the solution fully supports the user’s job and make changes as necessary.

#### JTBD in Action: A Detailed Example

* **Scenario**: A streaming service wants to better understand why customers subscribe.
* **Research Findings**:
  * Job Statements: "When I have free time, I want to relax and find something interesting to watch so that I feel entertained and informed."
  * **Functional Jobs**: Discover new shows, watch without advertisements.
  * **Emotional Jobs**: Feel relaxed, avoid boredom.
  * **Social Jobs**: Recommend popular shows, feel in-the-know.
* **Implementation Steps**:
  * **Identify Gaps**: The service noticed that customers found it hard to discover shows aligned with their moods.
  * **Develop Solutions**: They implemented a "Mood Filter" to let users find content by how they feel (e.g., "light-hearted," "thought-provoking").
  * **Prototype Testing**: Feedback showed increased engagement when using the mood filter.
  * **Outcomes**: The feature improved customer satisfaction and reduced the time spent browsing.

#### Final Tips

* **Stay Outcome-Focused**: Always return to the core job to avoid adding unnecessary features.
* **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Involve designers, developers, and product strategists so the entire team aligns on the job.
* **Continuous Validation**: Regularly check if the product meets the job as user needs may evolve.
