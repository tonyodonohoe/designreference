# Field Studies

Field studies involve conducting research or gathering data directly in the real-world context where the subject of study naturally occurs. It typically involves observing and interacting with individuals or groups in their natural environment to gain insights into their behaviours, preferences, and experiences. Researchers often visit specific locations, conduct interviews, administer surveys, or perform experiments to collect data first-hand. Field studies provide a deeper understanding of real-world dynamics, social interactions, and contextual factors that may impact the subject of study. This research approach enables researchers to gather rich and authentic data, leading to valuable insights and informing the development of more relevant and user-centric solutions or interventions.
