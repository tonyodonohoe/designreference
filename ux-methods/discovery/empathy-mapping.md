Empathy mapping helps designers understand and connect with the end-users on a deeper level. It involves creating a visual representation of a user's thoughts, feelings, and needs.

To create an empathy map, you typically divide it into four quadrants: "What the user Says," "Thinks," "Feels," and "Does." Designers collect insights through user research, such as interviews and observations, to fill in these quadrants. This process fosters a holistic view of users, enabling designers to develop more user-centric solutions.

Empathy mapping is crucial because it bridges the gap between design and user needs. It enhances communication within design teams and ensures that the final product aligns with the user's perspective.
