# Focus Groups

A focus group is a qualitative research method that involves bringing together a small group of individuals to discuss a specific topic, product, or service.&#x20;

It is typically facilitated by a moderator who guides the group discussion. The participants share their opinions, experiences, and perceptions on the subject matter, providing valuable insights into their attitudes, preferences, and behaviours. Focus groups encourage open dialogue, allowing participants to interact with one another and build upon each other's ideas.&#x20;

Researchers use this method to gather in-depth qualitative data, explore diverse perspectives, and uncover underlying motivations or concerns. The findings from focus groups inform decision-making, product development, marketing strategies, and other business initiatives by providing a deeper understanding of the target audience and their needs.
