# User Experience Mapping

A user experience map is like a treasure map for businesses. It shows what customers need, expect, and want, and how they might journey towards a goal, such as buying a product or using a service. By understanding this map, companies can design a better experience for their customers, making it easier and more enjoyable for them to reach their destination. It's a tool that helps businesses make their customers happier and more successful in using their products or services.
