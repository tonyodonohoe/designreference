# IA Research Study

An information architecture (IA) research study involves investigating and evaluating the organisation and structure of information within a system or website.&#x20;

It focuses on understanding how users navigate, find, and interact with information to achieve their goals. IA research studies employ methods such as user interviews, card sorting exercises, tree testing, and usability testing to gain insights into users' mental models, information needs, and preferences.&#x20;

By conducting IA research, businesses can identify opportunities to improve the organisation, labelling, and navigation of information, resulting in enhanced user experiences and improved findability of content. The findings from an IA research study inform the design and development of intuitive and user-friendly information structures that support efficient and effective information retrieval.
