# Context Mapping

Context Mapping refers to the process of understanding and visualising the broader environment in which a product or service will be used. It involves exploring the various factors that can influence a user's experience. Data is collected on user behaviors, needs, and the physical or digital spaces where the product will be used. This data helps in creating a clear picture of the user's context.

For instance, if designing a mobile app for commuters, context mapping would involve considering factors like the user's location, time of day, their goals while using the app, and any potential distractions. This holistic view aids in tailoring the user interface and experience to be more relevant and effective within that specific context. By understanding the context, designers can make user-centered decisions that lead to better, more intuitive designs, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.
