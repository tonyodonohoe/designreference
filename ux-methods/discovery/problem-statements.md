# Problem Statements

_AKA User Need Statements, Needs Statements, Point-of-View Statements_

Problem statements are concise descriptions that highlight a specific issue, challenge, or opportunity that needs to be addressed. They provide a clear and focused articulation of the problem to be solved or the goal to be achieved. Problem statements typically define the gap between the current state and the desired state, emphasising the impact or significance of the problem. They help teams and stakeholders understand the problem's context, scope, and implications. By formulating problem statements, organisations can align efforts, prioritise initiatives, and guide decision-making. Problem statements serve as a foundation for problem-solving, innovation, and planning, enabling teams to develop targeted strategies and solutions that directly address the identified problem or opportunity.
