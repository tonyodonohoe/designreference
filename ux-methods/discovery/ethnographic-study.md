# Ethnographic Study

Ethnographic research is the study of people in their everyday lives. It is a qualitative research method, originally from anthropology, where researchers watch and interact with people in their natural environment to understand their behaviours and the context around them. This approach helps uncover what people truly need and do, rather than just what they say.
