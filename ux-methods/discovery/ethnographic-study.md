# Ethnographic Study

Ethnographic research is the study of people in their everyday lives. It is a qualitative research method, originally from anthropology, where researchers watch and interact with people in their natural environment to understand their behaviours and the context around them.&#x20;

This approach helps uncover what people truly need and do, rather than just what they say.
