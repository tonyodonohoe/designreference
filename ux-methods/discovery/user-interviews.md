# User Interviews

User interviews involve engaging with individuals who represent the target audience or user base of a product, service, or experience. These interviews aim to gather insights about users' needs, preferences, behaviours, and pain points. By conducting user interviews, researchers and designers can gain a deeper understanding of user perspectives, motivations, and goals. The interviews are typically conducted in a conversational manner, allowing users to express their thoughts, experiences, and feedback. User interviews help uncover valuable insights that inform the design process, improve user experiences, and validate assumptions. They provide an opportunity to empathise with users, gather qualitative data, and generate ideas for enhancements or innovations. User interviews contribute to user-cantered design by ensuring that products or services meet user needs and align with their expectations.
