# Observation

A method of investigation in which designers closely observe and analyse people interacting with a product, system, or service in their natural environment or a controlled setting. The primary aim is to gain a deeper understanding of user interactions, identify usability issues, and uncover unspoken needs and concerns that users might struggle to express overtly. This approach often assists in identifying trends, pauses, and emotional reactions, ensuring that the design is in harmony with user expectations.
