# First Principles Thinking

First principles thinking involves breaking down a complex problem into its most basic components. By questioning underlying assumptions and focusing on fundamental truths, this approach challenges conventional wisdom and encourages critical thinking. This can lead to innovative solutions.

In UX design, first principles thinking is particularly valuable during the Discovery phase. By applying this method, designers can challenge assumptions, gain deeper user insights, uncover true needs, and develop innovative solutions that go beyond surface-level requirements.
