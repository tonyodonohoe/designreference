Customer experience mapping is a visual process used to understand the entire story of a person's interaction with a brand or service. It looks at every single touchpoint, from the moment someone first hears about a product to the final stage of support or renewal. By laying this out clearly, teams can see exactly how a customer feels at each step and where they might be facing difficulties.

Instead of just looking at one specific task, this method focuses on the person's emotions and motivations over time. It helps businesses identify gaps in their service where the experience might be inconsistent or frustrating. By seeing the world through the eyes of the user, a company can move away from internal assumptions and start making decisions based on real human behaviour.

The final map serves as a shared guide for everyone in an organisation, ensuring that designers, developers, and managers are all working towards the same goal. It makes it much easier to prioritise improvements that will have the biggest impact on customer satisfaction. Ultimately, this method is about building empathy and creating a smoother, more enjoyable journey for the people using a service.
