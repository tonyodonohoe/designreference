It involves bringing together key stakeholders, team members, and relevant individuals to align on goals, objectives, and project expectations. During the kick-off meeting, the project scope, timeline, roles, and responsibilities are discussed and clarified. It serves as an opportunity to establish clear communication channels, address any questions or concerns, and foster a shared understanding among the participants.&#x20;
