# Contextual Inquiry

Contextual inquiry is a user research method where researchers observe and interview users in their natural environment while they perform tasks related to a product or system. This approach helps understand users' needs, motivations, and challenges within their specific context. By directly observing users in real-world situations, contextual inquiry provides valuable insights for designing user-centric solutions and improving the user experience. It's important to note that while similar a contextual inquiry and a contextual user interview are not the same. A contextual user interview emphasises in-depth interviews in the user's environment, with less emphasis on direct observation whereas a contextual inquiry on the other hand combines both observation and interviewing, focusing on users' workflow and context.
