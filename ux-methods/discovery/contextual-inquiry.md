# Contextual Inquiry

Contextual inquiry is a user research method where researchers observe and interview users in their natural environment while they perform tasks related to a product or system.&#x20;

This approach helps understand users' needs, motivations, and challenges within their specific context. By directly observing users in real-world situations, contextual inquiry provides valuable insights for designing user-centric solutions and improving the user experience.

#### The Distinction between 'Contextual Inquiry' and 'Contextual User Interviews'

It is important to note that while similar a Contextual Inquiry and a Contextual User Interview are not the same. A Contextual User Interview emphasises in-depth interviews in the user's environment, with less emphasis on direct observation whereas a Contextual Inquiry on the other hand combines both observation and interviewing, focusing on users' workflow and context.

Think of it as a matter of depth and methodology. A contextual interview is a broad term for any interview that takes place in the user’s environment, whereas Contextual Inquiry is a specific, structured ethnographic technique with its own set of "rules."

#### The Key Differences

**Contextual Inquiry (The Methodology)**

Contextual Inquiry is a defined field research technique. It is built on the Master-Apprentice model, where the researcher acts as an apprentice learning a craft from the user (the master). It relies on four specific principles:

* Context: Data is gathered at the site of the work/action.
* Partnership: The user and researcher work together to understand the user’s workflow.
* Interpretation: The researcher shares observations with the user to ensure the conclusions are correct.
* Focus: The researcher keeps the inquiry aligned with the specific goals of the project.

**Contextual User Interviews (The General Practice)**

This is a more flexible, less formalised approach. It refers to an interview conducted in the user's natural habitat (their office, home, or a shop) rather than a lab.

* It may involve just a standard Q\&A session while sitting in the environment.
* It does not necessarily require the "Master-Apprentice" relationship.
* It focuses on gathering verbal feedback while the user is surrounded by the tools and triggers they normally use.

**Why the distinction matters**

If you tell a UX team you are doing a Contextual Inquiry, they will expect you to spend a significant amount of time quietly observing the user "doing" the work and only interrupting for clarification.

If you say you are doing a Contextual Interview, you might spend the whole time talking. The former is better for discovering "hidden" behaviours the user isn't even aware they do, while the latter is better for understanding how the environment influences their opinions.

Would you like me to put together a set of interview questions tailored for a specific environment you are planning to visit?
