# Behavioural Analytics

Behavioural analytics is a branch of analytics that focuses on understanding and analysing user behaviours and interactions within a digital platform or system.&#x20;

It involves tracking and examining user actions, such as clicks, navigation paths, transactions, and engagement patterns, to gain insights into user preferences, motivations, and decision-making processes.&#x20;

By analysing these behavioural data points, organisations can make data-driven decisions, optimise user experiences, personalise content, and improve overall performance.&#x20;

Behavioural analytics provides valuable insights into user behaviour, allowing businesses to enhance their strategies, optimise conversions, and deliver targeted experiences that align with user needs and goals.
