# Project Brief

A project brief is a concise document that outlines the key details, objectives, and scope of a project. It provides an overview of the project's purpose, desired outcomes, and constraints. A project brief typically includes information such as project goals, deliverables, timeline, budget, and stakeholders. It serves as a reference point and communication tool for all parties involved, ensuring a shared understanding of the project's scope and requirements. The project brief acts as a foundation for project planning and execution, guiding decision-making, resource allocation, and project management activities. It helps stakeholders and team members stay aligned and focused on achieving the project's objectives. The project brief sets the stage for effective collaboration, enabling stakeholders to provide input and make informed decisions throughout the project lifecycle.
