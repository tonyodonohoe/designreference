# Free-listing

Free-listing is a straightforward research technique used to uncover how people categorise and prioritise information within a specific topic.&#x20;

The process involves asking a participant to list every item that comes to mind for a particular category, such as the features expected in a banking app or the steps involved in booking a holiday. This approach is highly effective for capturing the vocabulary and concepts that people naturally associate with a product.

When the results are analysed across a group of participants, common patterns emerge based on how frequently an item is mentioned and the order in which it appears. Items listed first and most often are generally the most important or culturally significant to that audience.&#x20;

Free-listing is often utilised in the early stages of product development to define a site map or navigation structure. For example, a team building a grocery app might ask participants to list every item they would expect to find in the "Dairy" aisle.&#x20;

If most people list eggs alongside milk and cheese, the designers gain clear evidence that eggs should be categorised there, even if they are technically not dairy. This ensures the digital layout matches the instinctive logic of a shopper.

Another common application involves identifying the most valued features of a service. In a study for a fitness tracker, researchers might ask participants to list all the things they track during a workout.&#x20;

If "heart rate" and "calories" consistently appear at the top of these lists across different users, it signals that these metrics deserve the most prominent placement on the primary dashboard.&#x20;

This method also works well for brand perception studies, where people list words they associate with a company, helping the team understand if the intended brand identity aligns with public reality.

Using this method helps a design team move beyond internal assumptions to build an experience that reflects the actual mental models of the people using it, ensuring that the most vital information remains a central focus.
