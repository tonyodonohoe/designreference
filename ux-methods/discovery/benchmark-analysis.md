# Benchmark Analysis

Benchmark analysis involves comparing the performance and usability of a specific product or website with industry standards or competitors.

This examination allows designers to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Metrics like page load times, navigation efficiency, and user satisfaction are scrutinised.&#x20;

The insights gained from benchmark analysis enable designers to make informed decisions, optimise user journeys, and create more user-centric digital experiences that resonate with an audience.
