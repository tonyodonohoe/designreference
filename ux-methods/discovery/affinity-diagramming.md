Affinity diagramming is a collaborative method used to organise and make sense of large amounts of information or ideas. It involves a group of participants who generate ideas or insights on individual cards or sticky notes, which are then grouped together based on their similarities or relationships. The process of affinity diagramming encourages collaboration, creativity, and the discovery of patterns or themes within the collected information. By visually clustering related ideas or concepts, affinity diagramming helps teams identify common themes, prioritise issues, and generate solutions. It provides a structured approach for organising complex information, facilitating discussions, and making informed decisions. Affinity diagramming is commonly used in problem-solving, brainstorming sessions, and user research to surface key insights and drive effective problem-solving and decision-making processes.
