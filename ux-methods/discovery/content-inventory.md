# Content Inventory

_AKA Content Inventory & Auditing_

Content inventory and auditing is the process of systematically collecting and evaluating all the content on a website or digital platform. It involves creating a detailed list of every piece of content and assessing its quality, relevance, and effectiveness. This helps identify outdated, redundant, or low-performing content that may need improvement or removal. Content inventory and auditing enable organisations to gain a clear understanding of their content assets, make informed decisions about content strategy, improve user experience, and ensure that the content aligns with business goals and user needs.
