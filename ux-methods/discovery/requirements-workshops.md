# Requirements Workshops

Requirements workshops are collaborative sessions conducted with key stakeholders, subject matter experts, and members of the project team to elicit, analyse, and prioritise requirements for a project or system. These workshops provide a structured environment for gathering information, clarifying expectations, and defining the needs and objectives of the project. Participants engage in discussions, brainstorming activities, and exercises to identify, validate, and document requirements. Requirements workshops promote collaboration, knowledge sharing, and alignment among stakeholders. They enable stakeholders to contribute their expertise, provide feedback, and ensure that all perspectives are considered in the requirements gathering process. By conducting requirements workshops, organisations can foster a shared understanding of project requirements, uncover potential conflicts or gaps, and facilitate consensus on priorities. The outcomes of requirements workshops serve as the foundation for project planning, development, and successful delivery.
