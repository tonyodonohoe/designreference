# Requirements Engineering

> “Requirements are the wants and needs of stakeholders clearly defined with acceptance criteria” — Association for Project Management (APM)

Requirements engineering is the framework for working through the whole requirements process, and it’s made up of five distinct phases/stages:

1. Elicitation: Sourcing the wants and needs of users and stakeholders.
2. Analysis: Ensuring your requirements are comprehensive, viable, prioritised and consistent.
3. Documentation: Recording your requirements in a neat, ordered package ready to communicate.
4. Validation: Ensuring the requirements are actually what users and stakeholders want/need, and accurately represent the solution you’re building.
5. Management: Maintaining and controlling the requirements, especially any changes.
