# User Scenarios

It is easy to confuse **User Stories** with **User Scenarios** or **Use Cases** but the three are different.&#x20;

User Scenarios are narratives or stories that describe specific situations or contexts in which users interact with a product or service.&#x20;

These scenarios depict the user's goals, motivations, and actions within a given context, highlighting the steps they take to accomplish a task or solve a problem. User scenarios provide a realistic and contextualised view of how users may engage with a system, considering factors such as their environment, needs, and constraints.&#x20;

They help designers and stakeholders understand user behaviours, pain points, and opportunities for improvement. User scenarios aid in the design process by guiding decision-making, shaping user experiences, and ensuring that the product or service meets user needs effectively.&#x20;

By envisioning and designing for user scenarios, organisations can create more relevant and impactful solutions that align with users' real-world situations and expectations.
