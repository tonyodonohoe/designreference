# User Scenarios

It is easy to confuse user stories with user scenarios or use cases but the three are different. User scenarios are narratives or stories that describe specific situations or contexts in which users interact with a product or service. These scenarios depict the user's goals, motivations, and actions within a given context, highlighting the steps they take to accomplish a task or solve a problem. User scenarios provide a realistic and contextualised view of how users may engage with a system, considering factors such as their environment, needs, and constraints. They help designers and stakeholders understand user behaviours, pain points, and opportunities for improvement. User scenarios aid in the design process by guiding decision-making, shaping user experiences, and ensuring that the product or service meets user needs effectively. By envisioning and designing for user scenarios, organisations can create more relevant and impactful solutions that align with users' real-world situations and expectations.
