# Card Sorting

Card sorting is a research technique used to understand how users organise and categorise information.&#x20;

It involves participants sorting a set of cards or items into groups based on their perceived similarities or relationships. Participants may also provide labels or names for the groups they create.&#x20;

Card sorting helps designers and researchers gain insights into user mental models, information hierarchy, and navigation preferences. It aids in information architecture design, content organisation, and menu structure.&#x20;

By conducting card sorting sessions, organisations can uncover patterns in how users perceive and group information, informing the design of intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.&#x20;

Card sorting can be conducted through physical cards or online tools, and the results are analysed to inform the structure and layout of digital products, websites, or applications.
