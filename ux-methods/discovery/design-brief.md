# Design Brief

A design brief is a concise document that outlines the goals, objectives, and constraints for a design project. It serves as a roadmap for the entire design team, ensuring everyone is aligned on the vision and direction of the product.

By creating a well-defined design brief, product design teams can ensure that their efforts are focused, aligned, and ultimately successful.

#### Key Components of a Design Brief:

1. **Project Overview:**
   * **Project Name:** A clear and concise title.
   * **Project Goal:** The overall purpose or desired outcome of the product.
   * **Target Audience:** The specific group of people the product is designed for.
2. **Problem Statement:**
