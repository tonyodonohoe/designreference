# Design Sprint

### Overview

The main objective of a design sprint is to efficiently create and validate a prototype within a five-day timeframe. By assembling a small team and dedicating a week exclusively to the process, you can swiftly move from identifying the problem to testing a viable solution, following a well-established, systematic checklist. The design sprint methodology, made popular by Google Ventures, involves a series of structured activities that encourage cross-functional collaboration and rapid decision-making.

During a design sprint, the team typically goes through the following key phases across 5 days:

1. **Map**: The team gathers information, defines the problem, and aligns on the goals and objectives of the sprint.
2. **Sketch**: Team members individually generate ideas and concepts through sketching. This encourages diverse thinking and generates multiple solutions.
3. **Decide**: The team reviews and discusses the sketches, sharing insights and perspectives. They then collectively decide on the most promising ideas to pursue further.
4. **Prototype**: Using the chosen idea, the team creates a tangible prototype that represents the solution concept. This can range from low-fidelity sketches to interactive digital mockups, depending on the project requirements.
5. **Test**: The prototype is tested with users or stakeholders to gather feedback and validate assumptions. The insights gained help refine and iterate on the design.

The design sprint process allows teams to align their understanding, make informed decisions, gain valuable insights, rapidly explore multiple ideas, validate assumptions, create a tangible prototype that informs the next steps in the product development process and ultimately, reduce risks before committing to full-scale development.

Essentially, a design sprint enables a team to quickly and efficiently validate and iterate on ideas to solve a specific problem or create a new product or feature.

### Facilitating a Design Sprint

#### 1. **Preparation Timeframe**

Allow at least 2-3 weeks for preparation before the sprint. This will give you enough time to become familiar with the process, set up logistics, and ensure everything is in place for a smooth run.

#### 2. **Preparation Steps for the Facilitator**

1. **Understand the Sprint Process**
   * **Study the Design Sprint Methodology**: Read the GV Sprint book by Jake Knapp or watch online tutorials if pressed for time.
   * **Outline the Schedule**: Familiarise yourself with the flow, key activities, and desired outcomes for each day of the 4 or 5-day sprint.
2. **Identify and Secure Participants**
   * **Key Roles**: The sprint team should include 5-7 people with diverse expertise—product owner, designer, developer, marketer, and ideally a decision-maker (e.g., someone who can make final calls).
   * **Invite Participants**: Reach out to these individuals and secure their commitment for the sprint days.
3. **Select and Brief the Decision Maker**
   * **Ensure Involvement**: The decision maker needs to attend on Day 1 and Day 4. Schedule a prep session to discuss their role and the importance of timely decisions to keep the sprint on track.
4. **Prepare the Sprint Workspace**
   * **Physical or Virtual**: Decide if the sprint will be in-person or remote. For in-person sprints, book a dedicated space with ample room for whiteboards or sticky notes. For virtual sprints, set up tools like Miro or MURAL, and ensure everyone has access to video conferencing software, like Zoom or Google Meet.
5. **Set Up Materials**
   * **For In-Person**: Stock up on sticky notes, whiteboards, markers, and printed templates for sketching exercises.
   * **For Virtual**: Create digital versions of each day's exercises. Set up boards for brainstorming, user journeys, voting, and prototyping.

#### 3. **Tasks to Complete in Advance**

1. **Define the Sprint Challenge**:
   * **Problem Statement**: Work with stakeholders to clearly define the problem or opportunity the sprint will address. This should be a specific, actionable challenge.
   * **Sprint Goal**: Outline a clear, measurable goal for the sprint—something that can be tested with users by the end.
2. **Collect Background Information**
   * **Research and Insights**: Gather any existing research, user feedback, and analytics to provide context. Prepare to present this at the start of Day 1.
3. **Create a Detailed Agenda**
   * **Outline Each Day's Schedule**: Set time slots for each activity and plan to keep everyone focused and on track.
4. **Plan User Testing (if Day 5 is included)**
   * **Identify Test Users**: Recruit 5 users who represent the target audience. If remote, ensure they have access to the tools they'll need.
   * **Draft a Script for Testing**: Prepare questions and tasks for users to complete with the prototype.

#### 4. **Running the Design Sprint: Day-by-Day Breakdown**

* **Day 1: Understand and Define the Problem**
  * **Morning**: Set the stage by reviewing the sprint challenge, objectives, and research insights.
  * **Activities**: Start with "[How Might We](how-might-we.md)" (HMW) notes, [map the user journey](../discovery/customer-journey-mapping.md), and hold lightning demos to examine existing solutions.
  * **Afternoon**: Work with the team to select the primary target for the sprint (a specific part of the journey) and agree on the long-term goal and key questions.
* **Day 2: Sketch Solutions**
  * **Morning**: Start with individual sketching sessions to explore different solutions.
  * **Activities**: Lead the team through exercises like "[Crazy 8s](crazy-eights.md)" for rapid ideation. Encourage everyone to produce a refined sketch of their best idea.
  * **Afternoon**: Wrap up with a "solution sketch" that includes sufficient detail to share with others.
* **Day 3: Decide on the Best Solution**
  * **Morning**: Conduct a "silent critique" by reviewing all sketches and voting on the most promising concepts.
  * **Activities**: Facilitate the "Decision" process by focusing on the highest-voted solution(s). Use a storyboard to flesh out the chosen concept in more detail.
  * **Afternoon**: Finalise the storyboard for a clear prototype path.
* **Day 4: Prototype**
  * **All Day**: Guide the team in creating a high-fidelity prototype that's realistic enough to test.
  * **Tools**: Set up tools like Figma or any other prototyping software. Ensure each team member has a clear role in creating the prototype.
  * **End of Day**: Review the prototype to ensure it flows well and covers the key points from the storyboard.
* **Day 5: Test with Users**
  * **Conduct User Testing**: Lead user testing sessions with 5 users, observing their interactions with the prototype.
  * **Document Feedback**: Note specific points of confusion, any positive responses, and feedback for improvement.
  * **Debrief with the Team**: Analyse the findings and discuss next steps, which may include a refined solution, further testing, or implementation planning.

#### 5. **Post-Sprint Wrap-Up**

* **Present Results**: Prepare a summary of the sprint outcomes and user feedback, highlighting any actionable next steps.
* **Follow-Up Plan**: Work with stakeholders to determine how and when to iterate on the prototype or bring the solution into development.

#### Additional Tips

* **Encourage Full Participation**: Remind the team that each voice is valuable, and set a tone for active engagement and open collaboration.
* **Time Management**: Stick closely to the schedule to keep energy levels high and ensure you reach the intended outcomes each day.
* **Keep Energy High**: Design Sprints can be intensive, so take breaks, keep the atmosphere light, and encourage creativity and flexibility.
