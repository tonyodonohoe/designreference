# Mood Boards

Moodboards are a visual tool used early in the design process to establish the aesthetic direction of a project. Instead of focusing on specific layouts or functional details, a moodboard gathers a collection of images, colours, textures, and fonts to convey a particular feeling or atmosphere. This helps the design team and stakeholders align on a visual style before any actual building begins.

Using a moodboard is an effective way to bridge the gap between abstract ideas and concrete design. It allows everyone involved to see how different elements work together, making it easier to identify what resonates with the target audience. By testing these visual concepts early on, you can avoid costly changes later in the process and ensure that the final product has a consistent and intentional look.

Beyond just looking nice, moodboards serve as a point of reference throughout the lifecycle of a project. They act as a visual North Star, keeping the team focused on the agreed-upon aesthetic. Whether you are creating a new brand identity or refreshing a mobile app, this method ensures that the creative vision remains clear and that all contributors are working toward the same visual goal.
