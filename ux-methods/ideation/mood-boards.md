# Mood Boards

Mood boards are visual collages that capture the desired look, feel, and atmosphere of a design project. In UX design, they serve as a source of inspiration, helping to convey the intended mood, tone, and brand identity. Moodboards aid in aligning stakeholders and guiding the visual direction of the user experience.
