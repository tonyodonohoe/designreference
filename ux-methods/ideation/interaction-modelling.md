# Interaction Modelling

Interaction modelling involves the creation and representation of the interactions between users and a system or interface.&#x20;

It focuses on understanding and designing the flow, sequence, and behaviour of user interactions with various components and features of a digital product or service. Interaction modelling helps define how users navigate through screens, interact with elements, and accomplish tasks within the system.&#x20;

It typically involves creating visual diagrams, such as wireframes, flowcharts, or interactive prototypes, to illustrate the user interface, input/output processes, and system responses.&#x20;

By employing interaction modelling, designers and developers can iteratively refine the user experience, anticipate user needs, and ensure that the interactions are intuitive, efficient, and aligned with the users' goals and expectations.
