# Scenario Mapping

Scenario mapping is a collaborative user experience method used to visualise the steps a person takes to achieve a specific goal. It involves breaking down a user's journey into a chronological sequence of actions, thoughts, and emotions to see how they interact with a product or service. By laying out these steps on a timeline, a design team can identify where a user might feel confused or frustrated, allowing them to spot gaps in the current experience before any development begins.

The process usually begins with a specific persona and a clear objective, such as a customer trying to return a faulty item or a new user signing up for a subscription. The team then maps out every touchpoint and decision the user encounters. This physical or digital map serves as a shared source of truth that helps prevent misunderstandings between designers, developers, and stakeholders. It forces the team to move beyond abstract ideas and focus on the practical reality of the user's situation.

In the final stages, scenario mapping helps to prioritise which features are truly necessary and which can be simplified. By seeing the entire flow in one view, it becomes much easier to identify opportunities for innovation or points where the process can be streamlined. It is an essential tool for creating a seamless experience because it ensures that every part of the journey is designed with a deep understanding of the human context behind each click or tap.
