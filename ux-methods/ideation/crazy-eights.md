Crazy Eights is a fast-paced sketching exercise used to generate a wide variety of design ideas in a very short amount of time. To begin, a single sheet of paper is folded into eight distinct sections. A timer is then set for eight minutes, providing exactly sixty seconds to sketch one unique idea in each square.

The goal is to focus on quantity rather than quality, pushing past initial, obvious thoughts to find more creative solutions. Because the time limit is so tight, there is no luxury for overthinking or worrying about the aesthetic quality of the drawings. It is an excellent way to break through mental blocks and explore different layout possibilities or features before committing to a final design. By the end of the session, the result is eight different concepts available for critique or refinement.

**Facilitation Guide**

To facilitate a Crazy Eights session, first ensure every participant has a piece of paper and a pen or marker. Instruct the group to fold the paper in half three times so that, when unfolded, there are eight equal rectangles.

The objective is to sketch one distinct idea in each box within a sixty-second limit per sketch. Emphasise that these drawings should be rough and that artistic ability is irrelevant. Once the group is ready, start a timer for one minute to begin the first sketch. When the minute expires, immediately announce the start of the next round and continue this rhythm until all eight boxes are filled.

Providing a ten-second warning before each minute ends helps to maintain high energy. After the eight minutes conclude, allow each person a few minutes to present their favourite ideas to the team. Small dot stickers or pens can then be used to vote on the concepts most promising for further development.
