# Question Storming

Question storming is a creative technique used in product design to generate a wide range of questions related to a specific topic or problem. It is a brainstorming activity that encourages divergent thinking and helps to uncover new insights and perspectives.

1. **Choose a topic or problem:** Identify the area you want to explore through question storming.
2. **Set a timer:** Limit the brainstorming session to a specific amount of time to maintain focus and energy.
3. **Generate questions:** Encourage participants to ask as many questions as possible, without judgment or criticism. The goal is to generate a diverse range of questions that explore different angles and perspectives.
4. **Categorise questions:** After the brainstorming session, group the questions into related categories to identify common themes and areas of interest.

Question storming can be used at various stages of the design process, but it is particularly valuable during the discovery and ideation phases:

* **Discovery:** Question storming can help to uncover user needs, pain points, and opportunities for improvement. By asking a wide range of questions, designers can gain a deeper understanding of the problem they are trying to solve.
* **Ideation:** Question storming can stimulate creative thinking and generate new ideas for potential solutions. By asking questions that challenge assumptions and explore different possibilities, designers can develop innovative and effective product concepts.

While question storming is primarily used in the early stages of the design process, it can also be helpful during the testing phase to identify areas for improvement and gather feedback from users. By asking targeted questions, designers can gain insights into how users interact with their product and identify areas where the design may need to be refined.
