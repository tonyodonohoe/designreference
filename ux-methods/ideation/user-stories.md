# User Stories

It is easy to confuse User Stories with User Scenarios or Use Cases [but the three are different](https://medium.com/@smartgamma/user-scenarios-user-stories-use-cases-what-s-the-difference-75bf75d4bb60).&#x20;

User stories are concise, user-focused descriptions of desired functionality or features within a software development or product management context.&#x20;

They capture the needs, goals, and motivations of the end users in a simple and understandable format.&#x20;

User stories typically follow the template:&#x20;

"As a \[type of user], I want \[a particular action or capability] so that \[a specific benefit or outcome]."&#x20;

They also contain details about what should happen, driven by context and other situations:&#x20;

"If \[context] and \[additional context] when \[event] then \[outcome]."&#x20;

As a jogger I want to track the distance I jog every week so that I can have a good understanding of how much I have exercised. If I stop jogging and I stop for more than fifteen minutes, then the record of my jog should be saved as a new jog.&#x20;

These stories help prioritise and communicate user requirements in an accessible way, guiding the development team's understanding of what needs to be built.&#x20;

User stories provide a user-centric perspective, allowing teams to focus on delivering value to users and aligning product development efforts with user needs. They serve as a foundation for agile development, aiding in iterative development, and facilitating collaboration between stakeholders, designers, and developers.
