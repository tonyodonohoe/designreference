# SCAMPER

SCAMPER is a creative thinking technique used to improve products, services, or processes by looking at them through seven different lenses. The name is an acronym where each letter represents a specific way to rethink an existing idea: substitute, combine, adapt, modify, put to another use, eliminate, and reverse. By systematically working through these prompts, design teams can break out of routine thinking and discover innovative solutions that might not be immediately obvious.

When using this method, you start with an existing concept and ask questions based on each category. For instance, you might ask what would happen if you combined two features or what could be eliminated to make the interface simpler. This structured approach helps to expand your perspective and encourages a playful yet productive exploration of new possibilities. It is especially useful when a project feels stuck or when a product needs a fresh update to stay competitive.

Because it relies on modifying what already exists, SCAMPER is a highly practical tool for iterative design. It allows teams to refine and evolve their work by testing various transformations in a low-risk environment. The simplicity of the method means it can be applied to anything from a small app feature to a complex customer service journey. It serves as a reminder that innovation often comes from clever adjustments to current ideas rather than starting from a blank page every time.
