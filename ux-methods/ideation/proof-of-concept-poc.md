# Proof-of-Concept (PoC)\*

In UX design, a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is a prototype created to assess the feasibility of a design idea. It's an early-stage demonstration that tests usability and gathers feedback. By building a simplified version of the product or feature, designers can evaluate key elements and interactions. Wireframes, mockups, or interactive prototypes are used to showcase functionality and user experience.&#x20;

The PoC helps validate assumptions, identify design challenges, and refine the concept based on user insights. It differs from a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as it focuses on validating a specific design approach rather than the entire product's functionality.
