# Ideation Cards

Ideation cards are typically small cards or pieces of paper that contain ideas, prompts, or design concepts.&#x20;

Designers and teams use them during brainstorming and ideation phases to generate innovative solutions for a design problem. Each card might have a single word, a phrase, an image, or a question related to the project's goals. Participants draw cards randomly or select them deliberately to inspire new ideas.&#x20;

Ideation cards encourage out-of-the-box thinking, help break mental blocks, and foster collaboration by prompting discussions around different aspects of a design challenge. They can cover various elements like user needs, features, or user interface elements.
