# SCAMPER+

SCAMPER+ is an extended version of the SCAMPER technique in UX design. It adds two additional steps: Parallel thinking and Perspective. Parallel thinking encourages considering multiple viewpoints simultaneously, while Perspective prompts designers to approach the problem from different angles or user personas. SCAMPER+ enhances idea generation and promotes holistic and user-centric design solutions.
