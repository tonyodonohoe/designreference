# Gallery Walk

A Gallery Walk is a collaborative UX method used to share ideas and gather feedback across a team in a dynamic way. Instead of sitting through a long presentation, participants pin their work, such as wireframes, personas, or research findings, onto the walls of a room. This transforms the space into a temporary exhibition where everyone can move around at their own pace to review the displayed materials.

As people walk through the "gallery," they use sticky notes or pens to leave comments, ask questions, or vote on their favourite concepts. This approach encourages movement and keeps energy levels high, making it much more engaging than a standard meeting. It allows every team member to contribute their thoughts simultaneously, ensuring that even the quietest voices are heard and documented.

Once everyone has completed the circuit, the team gathers to discuss the most common themes and critiques. This process helps to build a shared understanding of the project's direction and highlights areas that need more work. It is an efficient way to synthesise diverse perspectives and reach a consensus before moving on to the next stage of the design process.

**Facilitation**

To facilitate a successful Gallery Walk, the physical or digital space must first be prepared. Large areas of wall space are cleared to accommodate designs, sketches, or research data, which should be printed at a scale legible from a short distance. These materials are arranged in a logical sequence around the perimeter to ensure a natural flow and prevent bottlenecks. An adequate supply of adhesive notes and markers must be provided for all participants.

At the commencement of the session, the objective is clearly defined for the group. The allocated duration and the specific nature of the required feedback, such as the identification of pain points or the highlighting of effective solutions, are established. The use of colour-coded adhesive notes or a fixed number of voting stickers may be utilised to maintain organised and visual data collection.

During the movement phase, the facilitator monitors the time and ensures participants progress through the gallery to avoid stagnation at any single station. Specificity in written critiques is required to ensure the feedback remains actionable. Silence is maintained during this period to allow for independent thought and to prevent the undue influence of peer discussion.

Upon completion of the walk, a structured group discussion is conducted, focusing on stations that received the highest volume of comments or votes. Creators are invited to address feedback or clarify queries raised during the review. This concluding analysis ensures a collective understanding of the results and assists the team in determining the necessary actions for the subsequent project iteration.
