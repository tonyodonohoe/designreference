# Role Playing

Role playing is a technique in UX design where participants take on specific roles, such as users or personas, to simulate real-world interactions and experiences. It helps designers empathize with users, gain insights into their perspectives, and uncover usability issues. Role-playing enhances user-centric design and promotes effective problem-solving.
