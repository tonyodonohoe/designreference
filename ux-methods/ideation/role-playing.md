# Role Playing

Role playing is a dynamic user experience method where team members act out scenarios to better understand how a person might interact with a product or service. By stepping into the shoes of a user, designers and researchers can explore the emotional and practical journey of a task in real time. This process helps to uncover pain points and social nuances that are often missed in static diagrams or written reports.

During a session, participants take on specific roles, such as a customer trying to solve a problem or a staff member providing assistance. They move through a physical or digital space to see how the environment influences behaviour. This physical movement often sparks new realisations about the flow of an interface or the clarity of instructions. It is a particularly effective way to build empathy within a team because it forces everyone to consider the user's perspective through direct experience.

The ultimate goal of role playing is to identify friction before a single line of code is written or a physical space is built. It allows for rapid prototyping of ideas and social interactions, making it easier to refine a concept based on human behaviour. Because it is low cost and requires very little equipment, it is a versatile tool for any stage of the design process.
