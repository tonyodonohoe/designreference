# User Story Mapping

User story mapping is a collaborative technique used to visualise and organise user stories in a structured and meaningful way. It involves creating a visual representation of the user journey or product flow by arranging user stories into a cohesive narrative. User story mapping helps teams gain a holistic view of the product or project and facilitates the identification of user needs and priorities. The technique typically involves using sticky notes or cards on a wall or digital platform to arrange user stories in a logical sequence, capturing the user's experience from start to finish. By creating a user story map, teams can identify dependencies, gaps, and opportunities for delivering value to users. It aids in prioritisation, backlog refinement, and ensures that the development efforts are focused on addressing user needs and achieving desired outcomes. User story mapping promotes collaboration, shared understanding, and supports the iterative development process.
