A prioritisation matrix helps designers assess and prioritise ideas based on their impact and implementation effort. It involves plotting ideas on a matrix to compare and decide which ones to pursue, focusing on high-impact, low-effort options. This tool aids discussions, prioritises features, and maximises the final product's impact.
