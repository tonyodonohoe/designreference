# Design Excursions

Design Excursions in UX Design refer to exploratory activities or research trips taken by designers to gain inspiration, gather insights, and observe user behaviour in real-world contexts. By immersing themselves in different environments, designers can discover new perspectives and generate fresh ideas that inform the design process.
