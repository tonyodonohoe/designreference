# Wireframing

Wireframing is a fundamental part of the design process where you create a basic, low-fidelity outline of a webpage or app screen. You can think of it as a blueprint for a building, focusing on where elements like buttons, images, and text will go without worrying about colours, fonts, or branding. By stripping away the visual polish, designers can concentrate on the structure and layout to ensure the user journey is logical and easy to follow.

The main goal of wireframing is to communicate the functionality of a page to the rest of the team and stakeholders early on. It allows everyone to see how different parts of the interface will interact and how content will be prioritised. Because these sketches are simple and quick to produce, they are very easy to change. This makes it much cheaper to catch and fix usability issues or structural flaws at this stage rather than waiting until the software is being built or the final graphics are finished.

In a professional setting, wireframes act as a bridge between the initial abstract ideas and the final product. They provide a clear map for developers and a visual guide for content creators, ensuring that the entire team is aligned on the layout before moving into more detailed design phases. Ultimately, wireframing helps to build a solid foundation for a product, ensuring that it is functional and intuitive for the end user.
