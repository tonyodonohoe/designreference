# Reverse Ideation

Reverse ideation is an ideation technique in UX design where the problem or desired outcome is reversed, focusing on generating ideas for achieving the opposite effect. By examining potential obstacles or negative scenarios, designers can uncover valuable insights, anticipate user needs, and develop effective strategies to avoid or address those challenges.
