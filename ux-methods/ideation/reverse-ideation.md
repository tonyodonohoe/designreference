# Reverse Ideation

AKA Reverse Brainstorming
{% endhint %}

Reverse ideation, which is also commonly known as reverse brainstorming, is a creative problem-solving technique that involves looking at a challenge from the opposite perspective. Instead of asking how to achieve a specific goal or solve a problem, you ask how you could cause the problem or ensure the project fails. This shift in focus helps teams identify potential pitfalls and hidden obstacles that might not be obvious during a standard brainstorming session. It is particularly useful in user experience design because it allows practitioners to see exactly what might frustrate a user or lead to a poor interface.

The process begins by clearly defining the problem and then intentionally reversing it. For example, if the goal is to improve website navigation, you would brainstorm ways to make the navigation as confusing and difficult as possible. By listing these negative actions, you create a roadmap of what to avoid. Once you have a list of ways to make the experience worse, you flip those points back into positive solutions. This method often helps teams break through creative blocks because it is generally easier and more natural for people to criticise or find faults than it is to generate flawless new ideas from scratch.

Ultimately, this method bridges the gap between identifying risks and generating innovations. By turning negative scenarios into constructive design requirements, you ensure that the final product is more robust and user-friendly. It encourages a deeper level of analysis and helps designers move past obvious answers to find more effective, practical improvements. This approach is highly valued in collaborative environments because it removes the pressure to be perfect and instead uses critical thinking to build a better overall experience.
