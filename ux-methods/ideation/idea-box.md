# Idea Box

An Idea Box is a tool used in UX design to gather and collect creative ideas from team members or users. It provides a platform for sharing and capturing innovative suggestions, encouraging collaboration and brainstorming. These ideas can then be evaluated and integrated into the design process to enhance user experiences.
