# Speed Dating

Speed dating is a fast paced research method used to quickly test several different design concepts or ideas with users. Much like the social event it is named after, this technique involves presenting a series of storyboards or sketches to a participant in quick succession. The goal is not to find a final solution, but rather to gauge the user's immediate reactions and preferences across a wide range of possible directions.

During a session, the researcher shows a participant a specific scenario and a potential solution, then asks for feedback before moving swiftly to the next one. This rapid cycle prevents the user from becoming too attached to a single idea and encourages them to compare the merits of different approaches. It is particularly effective for exploring bold or "out there" concepts that might otherwise be dismissed, as it allows the team to see which underlying ideas resonate most strongly with the audience.

By the end of the process, the design team can identify common themes and clear winners amongst the many concepts presented. This helps to narrow down the focus to the most promising paths, saving time and resources that might have been spent developing less effective ideas. Because it relies on low fidelity sketches or storyboards, speed dating is an excellent way to validate early stage strategy and ensure the project is heading in a direction that truly meets user needs.
