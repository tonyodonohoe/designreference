# Co-Creation Workshops

AKA Collaborative Design Workshops
{% endhint %}

Co-creation workshops are collaborative sessions where designers, stakeholders, and actual users come together to solve problems as a team.&#x20;

Instead of designers working in isolation and then asking for feedback later, this method invites everyone into the creative process from the very start. During these workshops, participants use hands-on activities like sketching or mapping to explore ideas and build solutions together.&#x20;

This approach ensures that the final product truly reflects the needs and behaviours of the people using it because they helped build it. By breaking down the barriers between the creators and the audience, you foster a sense of shared ownership and uncover unique insights that a single person might miss. It is a practical way to ensure your design decisions are grounded in real world experience while making sure everyone involved is on the same page.
