# Storyboards

Storyboarding is a visual storytelling technique used in UX design to illustrate user journeys or scenarios. It involves creating a series of sequential sketches or frames that depict key interactions and experiences. Storyboarding helps designers communicate and align on the intended narrative flow and user experience of a product or service.

Storyboards are visual representations that depict the sequence of events, actions, or interactions in a user experience. They consist of a series of illustrated frames or panels, accompanied by brief descriptions or captions. Storyboards are commonly used in user experience design to visually outline and communicate the flow of a story or user journey.&#x20;

They help stakeholders and designers visualise the intended narrative, explore different design ideas, and identify potential gaps or areas for improvement. Storyboards provide a visual storytelling tool that enables teams to align on the desired user experience, identify key interactions, and ensure a cohesive and engaging narrative. They serve as a valuable communication tool, facilitating collaboration, feedback, and iteration in the design and development process.
