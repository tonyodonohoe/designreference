# User Flow Diagrams

A user flow diagram is a visual representation that outlines the steps a user takes to accomplish a specific task or goal within a digital product, such as a website or mobile app. It maps out the sequence of actions, decisions, and potential outcomes as the user interacts with the interface.

Key elements of a user flow diagram include:

* **Entry points**: Where the user begins their journey, such as landing on a homepage or accessing a specific feature.
* **Actions**: The steps the user takes, like clicking a button, entering information, or navigating through menus.
* **Decisions**: Points where the user must make a choice that affects the flow, such as selecting between different options.
* **Outcomes**: The results of the user’s actions, including success, failure, or loops back to earlier steps.

These diagrams help designers understand how users move through a product and identify any potential pain points, ensuring that the user experience is as smooth and intuitive as possible. They are especially useful for collaboration among teams like UI/UX designers, product managers, and developers.
